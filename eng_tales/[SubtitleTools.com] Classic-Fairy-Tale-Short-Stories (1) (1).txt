Chapter 1- Little Mermaid Short Story




Once upon a time far out into the ocean where the water is deep blue

lives the Sea King in his magnificent Kingdom. The Sea Queen passed

away a long time ago and the King‘s mother looked after his beautiful

daughters. They were six beautiful children but the youngest was the

prettiest and purest of them all.

The princesses all had their own garden decorated with flowers and

objects they found from ship wrecks. The youngest princess garden was

different from her sisters, all it had was a marble statue of a handsome

boy. The youngest princess yearned to see the land above the sea and

her grandmother promised that when she turned 15 she will have

permission to rise the sea and watch the land above.

Each year one of the sisters would turn 15 and rise to the surface of the

ocean. As the years, past, each sister had different stories to tell. The

eldest loved the moonlight and gazing at the twinkling lights of the

town. The second sister saw the sun set and the third sister found a

troop of human children playing around in the water. The fourth sister

watched the ships from afar and fifth sister saw them sail through

lightening.

The youngest sister listened in awe to each story and the day came when

she finally turned 15. She rose lightly as a bubble to the surface of the

water and saw a large ship sailing along the calm sea. The little

mermaid swam closer and through the window panes there was a

handsome young prince who was rejoicing his birthday. The little

mermaid could not take her eyes off the beautiful prince. Suddenly

heavy clouds darkened the sky and a dreadful storm sent the great ship

flying amongst the sea in rage. The ship broke and the prince sank into

the waves. The little mermaid knew he could not live in water so she

dove into the water and saved him.

5



In the morning, the little mermaid found a bay and swam the prince

there. She then swam farther from the shore and watched to see what

would happen. A young girl who happened to be walking by found the

prince and he soon woke up and smiled at the young girl. The prince

however, did not see the little mermaid.

When the little mermaid went back to her sea kingdom she could not

forget about the prince. She found out from a friend where the prince‘s

palace was and from then onwards she would often swim near the shore

of his palace and watch the young prince.

The little mermaid grew more and more fond of the world above and

she asked her grandmother if humans die like mermaids. Her

grandmother told her that humans die much earlier than mermaids but

they had an immortal soul which lives forever whereas mermaids just

turn into foam and become nothing. The little mermaid felt sad that

mermaids could not have an immortal soul and she wished so hard that

she could have one.

Unable to stand her desire any longer, the little mermaid visited the sea

witch. The sea which promised to give her a pair of legs so that she can

live with the humans. The sea which said that every time the little

mermaid walked with her new pair of legs, it will feel like

knives piercing through her body. The sea witch also warned that for

the little mermaid to obtain an immortal soul, she must gain the love of

the prince. If the prince does not fall in love with her then she will turn

into foam on the day of his wedding to another. In return for the sea

witch‘s magic, the sea which took the little mermaids voice.

The little mermaid swam to shore and drank the magic potion. She felt a

sharp pain and fainted. When she woke up she saw that she had a pair

of pretty legs and just before her was the prince. The prince asked her

where she was from but she could not reply. The prince thought she was

very beautiful and took her into his palace where she was dressed in a

page dress. The prince said that the little mermaid should remain with

him always and she could sleep outside his door on a velvet cushion.

6



The little mermaid followed the prince almost everywhere, she rode

with him on horseback and accompanied him into the sweet-scented

woods.

One day the Prince was to marry a young princess of a neighboring

kingdom. The prince told the little mermaid that they must travel by sea

to visit this princess. He said that he would never love the princess. He

explained that the only girl he could possibly love would be the girl he

saw when he woke up after the ship accident. He believed it was that

girl who saved him. This made the little mermaid sad because the prince

did not know that his true savior was her.

The next morning, they arrived at the new kingdom. The princess

appeared and the little mermaid saw that she was very beautiful. The

prince cried: ―It was you, the one saved my life when I lay dead on the

beach!‖ and he folded his blushing bride in his arms.

The church bells rang, and the festive music played as the bride and

bridegroom went onboard the ship. The little mermaid knew this would

be last night she will spend as a human before she turns into nothing

but foam on the sea. She will never gain an immortal soul. During the

celebrations after the wedding the little mermaid danced very

gracefully. She smiled and laughed with the others for she knew this

was the last night she would spend in the human world.

At midnight, she wandered to the edge of the vessel and saw her sisters

waving her at mournfully. They had cut off their hair and given it to the

sea with in exchange for the little mermaid to have a chance to live.

They gave the little mermaid a knife and said that if she plunged the

knife into the prince‘s heart before sunrise then she can turn back into

a mermaid and live the rest of her life bountifully.

The little mermaid took the knife and she wandered into the prince‘s

tent. She could not bear to kill the prince so instead she tossed the knife

away and as she saw the first rays of sunrise, she threw herself into the

ocean. Instead of feeling her body turn into foam, she felt herself rising

higher and higher into the sky. She heard ethereal voices around her.

7



―We are the daughters among the air although we do not possess an

immortal soul we fly to countries and spread health and happiness, once

we have done as much good as we can for three hundred years we

receive an immortal soul, you have been so kind and tried with your

whole heart by your good deeds and will now join us in our journey‖

The little mermaid was happy beyond tears and she lifted her glorified

eyes towards the sun. She saw the prince and his beautiful bride look

sorrowfully at the sea, as if they knew she had thrown herself into the

waves.

The little mermaid mounted with the other children of the air and floated

to a rosy cloud, beginning her journey towards an immortal soul.





Chapter 2 Peter Pan


Wendy, John, and Michael Darling lived in London. One night, Wendy

woke to find a strange boy sitting on the floor who was crying.

―My name is Wendy,‖ she said. ―Who are you? Why are you crying?

―I‘m Peter Pan,‖ the boy replied. ―I‘m crying because my shadow won‘t

stick to me.‖

―Don‘t cry,‖ Wendy said. ―We can fix that.‖ And she sewed Peter‘s shadow

to the tips of his shoes. Peter was delighted.

―Fly back to Neverland with me and my fairy, Tinker Bell,‖ Peter begged.

―You could be our mother and take care of us.‖

―Can you teach me to fly?‖ Wendy asked. Peter nodded.

―Let‘s wake John and Michael,‖ Wendy said. ―You can teach us all to fly

and then we

will leave for Neverland!‖

8



The children were soon flying around the room. then—Swoosh! Out the

window they all flew.

Wendy, John, and Michael flew behind Peter Pan and Tinker Bell,

following the golden arrows that pointed the way to Neverland. Finally,

they were flying over the island.

―The lost boys live with me and Tinker Bell. I‘m their captain,‖ Peter said.

―The Indians live over there, and the mermaids live in the lagoon. And

there are pirates too, led by Captain Hook.‖

―Pirates?‖ exclaimed Wendy, John, and Michael, all in the same breath.

Wendy was frightened, but Michael and John wanted to see the pirates

right away.

―Hook‘s the meanest pirate ever,‖ Peter warned. ―But he‘s afraid of the

crocodile. The crocodile bit off Hook‘s hand and liked the taste so much

that it follows him, hoping for more. Luckily for Hook, the crocodile

swallowed a clock. It goes ‗Tick, Mock, and warns Hook when the

crocodile is nearby‖

―Oh, my‖ cried Wendy, not sure if she really wanted to stay in Neverland:

after all,

Peter led Wendy, John, and Michael to his house under the woods. They

entered through a door hidden in an old tree stump. When the lost boys

saw Wendy, they shouted, ―Hooray! Will you be our mother?‖

―I‘m only a little girl,‖ Wendy answered. ―I have no experience.‖ But the

lost boys looked so sad that she said, ―I‘ll do my best.‖

That night Wendy tucked the boys into bed and told them the tale of

Cinderella.

Life was pleasant in the cozy house under the woods.

Wendy took care of the boys, who explored the island during the day. At

night, they gathered for meals, played make- believe games, and listened

while Wendy told them stories.

9



One day, Peter and the children went exploring near the mermaids‘ lagoon.

Suddenly Peter yelled, ―Pirates! Take cover.‖ The boys ran away, and Peter

and Wendy hid.

Peter and Wendy could see that the pirates had tied up Tiger Lily, the

Indian princess. The pirates had left her on a rock in the lagoon.

Peter was afraid that Tiger Lily would drown when the tide came in. He

had to save her! In a voice that sounded just like Captain Hook‘s, he

shouted, ―Set her free!‖

―But, Captain,‖ the pirates yelled, ―you ordered us to bring her here!‖

―Let her go!‘ Peter roared, still sounding like Hook. ―Aye, aye,‖ the pirates

said, and set Tiger Lily free. She swam quickly back to the Indian camp.

When Captain Hook found out what had happened, he knew Peter had

tricked his pirates. Hook became furious!

That night, Wendy told the boys a story about three children who left their

parents and flew to Neverland. Their mother and father missed them very

much. The children loved Neverland, but they never forgot their home.

―Did they ever go back?‖ the lost boys asked.

―Oh, yes,‖ Wendy replied. ―They flew home to their mummy and daddy,

and everyone was happy.‖

The story made Wendy, John, and Michael homesick. They decided to fly

home the next morning. ―If you come back with us,‖ Wendy told the lost

boys, I‘m sure our mother and father would adopt you.‖

―Hooray!‖ shouted the boys, jumping with joy.

Wendy asked Peter if he and Tinker Bell would come home with them too.

But Peter didn‘t want to live where grown-ups could tell him what to do.

Peter was sad that his friends were leaving. Still, he wanted the children to

arrive home safely, so he asked Tinker Bell to guide them on their trip.

10



Early the next morning, Tinker Bell and the children left the house under

the woods. But Captain Hook‘s pirates were hiding nearby. They captured

all the children, tied them up, and marched them towards the pirate‘s ship.

Tinker Bell escaped, and hurried back to tell Peter what had happened.

―It‘s Hook or me this time!‖ yelled Peter to Tinker Bell as they flew off to

save Wendy and the boys.

On the pirate‘s ship, Captain Hook demanded, ―Who wants to become a

pirate?‖ The boys shook their heads.

―Then make them walk the plank!‖ Hook roared. The boys tried to look

brave, but they were afraid.

Suddenly, they heard the ―Tick, Tock‖ of the crocodile. Now it was Captain

Hook‘s turn to be afraid.

But the ―Tick, Tock‖ was only Peter, imitating the crocodile-. He flew onto

the deck and shouted, ―I‘ve got you now, Hook!‖ Captain Hook jumped up

and swung at Peter with his sword. Peter was quick, and stepped away. He

slashed at Hook with his own sword until they came close to the edge of

the ship.

Peter lunged with his sword, and Hook fell into the sea, where the

crocodile was waiting for him. And that was the end of Captain. I-look!

When Peter was certain that Hook was gone forever, he and Tinker Bell set

off for London with Wendy and the boys.

Wendy‘s parents were happy to see their children again. Mr. and Mrs.

Darling hugged Wendy, John, and Michael, and agreed to adopt the lost

boys. They asked Peter to stay with them also, but he said, ―I‘m going to

stay in Neverland where I never have to grow up.‖

―Goodbye then, Peter. We‘ll miss you,‖ everyone called. Peter Pan and

Tinker Bell waved goodbye and flew home to Neverland.

Chapter 3 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Story



Once upon a time in mid-winter, when the snowflakes were falling like

feathers from heaven, a beautiful queen sat sewing at her window, which

had a frame of black ebony wood. As she sewed, she looked up at the snow

and pricked her finger with her needle. Three drops of blood fell into the

snow. The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought, ―If only I

had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as this frame.‖

Soon afterward she had a little daughter that was as white as snow, as red

as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little

Snow-White.

Now the queen was the most beautiful woman in all the land, and very

proud of her beauty. She had a mirror, which she stood in front of every

morning, and asked:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

And the mirror always said:

You, my queen, are fairest of all.

And then she knew for certain that no one in the world was more beautiful

than she.

Now Snow-White grew up, and when she was seven years old, she was so

beautiful, that she surpassed even the queen herself. Now when the queen

asked her mirror:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mirror said:

You, my queen, are fair; it is true.

But Little Snow-White is still

12



A thousand times fairer than you.

When the queen heard, the mirror say this, she became pale with envy, and

from that hour on, she hated Snow-White. Whenever she looked at her, she

thought that Snow-White was to blame that she was no longer the most

beautiful woman in the world. This turned her heart around. Her jealousy

gave her no peace. Finally, she summoned a huntsman and said to him,

―Take Snow-White out into the woods to a remote spot, and stab her to

death. As proof that she is dead bring her lungs and her liver back to me. I

shall cook them with salt and eat them.‖

The huntsman took Snow-White into the woods. When he took out his

hunting knife to stab her, she began to cry, and begged fervently that he

might spare her life, promising to run away into the woods and never

return. The huntsman took pity on her because she was so beautiful, and

he thought, ―The wild animals will soon devour her anyway. I‘m glad that

I don‘t have to kill her.‖ Just then a young boar came running by. He killed

it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of

Snow-White‘s death. She cooked them with salt and ate them, supposing

that she had eaten Snow-White‘s lungs and liver.

Snow-White was now all alone in the great forest. She was terribly afraid,

and began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns the entire

day. Finally, just as the sun was about to set, she came to a little house. The

house belonged to seven dwarfs. They were working in a mine, and not at

home. Snow-White went inside and found everything to be small, but neat

and orderly. There was a little table with seven little plates, seven little

spoons, seven little knives and forks, seven little mugs, and against the wall

there were seven little beds, all freshly made.

Snow-White was hungry and thirsty, so she ate a few vegetables and a little

bread from each little plate, and from each little glass she drank a drop of

wine. Because she was so tired, she wanted to lie down and go to sleep. She

tried each of the seven little beds, one after the other, but none felt right

until she came to the seventh one, and she lay down in it and fell asleep.

13



When night came, the seven dwarfs returned home from the work. They lit

their seven little candles, and saw that someone had been in their house.

The first one said, ―Who has been sitting in my chair?‖

The second one, ―Who has been eating from my plate?‖

The third one, ―Who has been eating my bread?‖

The fourth one, ―Who has been eating my vegetables?‖

The fifth one, ―Who has been sticking with my fork?‖

The sixth one, ―Who has been cutting with my knife?‖

The seventh one, ―Who has been drinking from my mug?‖

Then the first one said, ―Who stepped on my bed?‖

The second one, ―And someone has been lying in my bed.‖

And so forth until the seventh one, and when he looked at his bed, he

found Snow-White lying there, fast asleep. The seven dwarfs all came

running, and they cried out with amazement. They fetched their seven

candles and looked at Snow-White. ―Good heaven! Good heaven!‖ they

cried. ―She is so beautiful!‖ They liked her very much. They did not wake

her up, but let her lie there in the bed. The seventh dwarf had to sleep with

his companions, one hour with each one, and then the night was done.

When Snow-White woke up, they asked her who she was and how she had

found her way to their house. She told them how her mother had tried to

kill her, how the huntsman had spared her life, how she had run the entire

day, finally coming to their house. The dwarfs pitied her and said, ―If you

will keep house for us, and cook, sew, make beds, wash, and knit, and keep

everything clean and orderly, then you can stay here, and you‘ll have

everything that you want. We come home in the evening, and supper must

be ready by then, but we spend the days digging for gold in the mine. You

will be alone then. Watch out for the queen, and do not let anyone in.‖

The queen thought that she was again the most beautiful woman in the

land, and the next morning she stepped before the mirror and asked:

14



Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mirror answered once again:

You, my queen, are fair; it is true.

But Little Snow-White beyond the seven mountains

Is a thousand times fairer than you.

It startled the queen to hear this, and she knew that she had been deceived,

that the huntsman had not killed Snow-White. Because only the seven

dwarfs lived in the seven mountains, she knew at once that they must have

rescued her. She began to plan immediately how she might kill her,

because she would have no peace until the mirror once again said that she

was the most beautiful woman in the land. At last she thought of

something to do. She disguised herself as an old peddler woman and

colored her face, so that no one would recognize her, and went to the

dwarf‘s house. Knocking on the door she called out, ―Open up. Open. I‘m

the old peddler woman with good wares for sale.‖

Snow-White peered out the window, ―What do you have?‖

―Bodice laces, dear child,‖ said the old woman, and held one up. It was

braided from yellow, red, and blue silk. ―Would you like this one?‖

―Oh, yes,‖ said Snow-White, thinking, ―I can let the old woman come in.

She means well.‖ She unbolted the door and bargained for the bodice laces.

―You are not laced up properly,‖ said the old woman. ―Come here, I‘ll do it

better.‖ Snow-White stood before her, and she took hold of the laces and

pulled them so tight that Snow-White could not breathe, and she fell as if

she were dead. Then the old woman was satisfied, and she went away.

Nightfall soon came, and the seven dwarfs returned home. They were

horrified to find their dear Snow-White lying on the ground as if she were

dead. They lifted her up and saw that she was laced up too tightly. They

cut the bodice laces in two, and then she could breathe, and she came back

15



to life. ―It must have been the queen who tried to kill you,‖ they said.

―Take care and do not let anyone in again.‖

The queen asked her mirror:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mirror answered once again:

You, my queen, are fair; it is true.

But Little Snow-White with the seven dwarfs

Is a thousand times fairer than you.

She was so horrified that the blood all ran to her heart, because she knew

that Snow-White had come back to life. Then for an entire day and a night

she planned how she might catch her. She made a poisoned comb,

disguised herself differently, and went out again. She knocked on the door,

but Snow-White called out, ―I am not allowed to let anyone in.‖

Then she pulled out the comb, and when Snow-White saw how it

glistened, and noted that the woman was a stranger, she opened the door,

and bought the comb from her. ―Come, let me comb your hair,‖ said the

peddler woman. She had barely stuck the comb into Snow-White‘s hair,

before the girl fell and was dead. ―That will keep you lying there,‖ said the

queen. And she went home with a light heart.

The dwarfs came home just in time. They saw what had happened and

pulled the poisoned comb from her hair. Snow-White opened her eyes and

came back to life. She promised the dwarfs not to let anyone in again.

The queen stepped before her mirror:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mirror answered:

You, my queen, are fair; it is true.

16



But Little Snow-White with the seven dwarfs

Is a thousand times fairer than you.

When the queen heard this, she shook and trembled with anger, ―Snow-

White will die, if it costs me my life!‖ Then she went into her most secret

room — no one else was allowed inside — and she made a poisoned,

poisoned apple. From the outside, it was red and beautiful, and anyone

who saw it would want it. Then she disguised herself as a peasant woman,

went to the dwarfs‘ house and knocked on the door.

Snow-White peeped out and said, ―I‘m not allowed to let anyone in. The

dwarfs have forbidden it most severely.‖

―If you don‘t want to, I can‘t force you,‖ said the peasant woman. ―I am

selling these apples, and I will give you one to taste.‖

―No, I can‘t accept anything. The dwarfs don‘t want me to.‖

―If you are afraid, then I will cut the apple in two and eat half of it. Here,

you eat the half with the beautiful red cheek!‖ Now the apple had been so

artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. When Snow-White saw

that the peasant woman was eating part of the apple, her desire for it grew

stronger, so she finally let the woman hand her the other half through the

window. She bit into it, but she barely had the bite in her mouth when she

fell to the ground dead.

The queen was happy, went home, and asked her mirror:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

And it answered:

You, my queen, are fairest of all.

―Now I‘ll have some peace,‖ she said, ―because once again I‘m the most

beautiful woman in the land. Snow-White will remain dead this time.‖

That evening the dwarfs returned home from the mines. Snow-White was

lying on the floor, and she was dead. They loosened her laces and looked in

17



her hair for something poisonous, but nothing helped. They could not

bring her back to life. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her

and cried and cried for three days. They were going to bury her, but they

saw that she remained fresh. She did not look at all like a dead person, and

she still had beautiful red cheeks. They had a glass coffin made for her, and

laid her inside, so that she could be seen easily. They wrote her name and

her ancestry on it in gold letters, and one of them always stayed at home

and kept watch over her.

Snow-White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and she did not decay.

She was still as white as snow and as red as blood, and if she had been able

to open her eyes, they still would have been as black as ebony wood. She

lay there as if she were asleep.

One day a young prince came to the dwarfs‘ house and wanted shelter for

the night. When he came into their parlor and saw Snow-White lying there

in a glass coffin, illuminated so beautifully by seven little candles, he could

not get enough of her beauty. He read the golden inscription and saw that

she was the daughter of a king. He asked the dwarfs to sell him the coffin

with the dead Snow-White, but they would not do this for any amount of

gold. Then he asked them to give her to him, for he could not live without

being able to see her, and he would keep her, and honor her as his most

cherished thing on earth. Then the dwarfs took pity on him and gave him

the coffin.

The prince had it carried to his castle, and had it placed in a room where he

sat by it the whole day, never taking his eyes from it. Whenever he had to

go out and was unable to see Snow-White, he became sad. And he could

not eat a bite, unless the coffin was standing next to him. Now the servants

who always had to carry the coffin to and for became angry about this. One

time one of them opened the coffin, lifted Snow-White upright, and said,

―We are plagued the whole day long, just because of such a dead girl,‖ and

he hit her in the back with his hand. Then the terrible piece of apple that

she had bitten off came out of her throat, and Snow-White came back to

life.

18



She walked up to the prince, who was beside himself with joy to see his

beloved Snow-White alive. They sat down together at the table and ate

with joy.

Their wedding was set for the next day, and Snow-White‘s godless mother

was invited as well. That morning she stepped before the mirror and said:

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mirror answered:

You, my queen, are fair; it is true.

But the young queen

Is a thousand times fairer than you.

She was horrified to hear this, and so overtaken with fear that she could

not say anything. Still, her jealousy drove her to go to the wedding and see

the young queen. When she arrived, she saw that it was Snow-White? Then

they put a pair of iron shoes into the fire until they glowed, and she had to

put them on and dance in them. Her feet were terribly burned, and she

could not stop until she had danced herself to death.



There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was

so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the

earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew

near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you will never

marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and

who has golden hair like mine.‘ Then when the king in his grief promised

all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.

The king was not to be comforted, and for a long time didn‘t think of

taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ―This will not do;

the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.‖ So, messengers

were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.

19



But there was no princess in the world who had golden hair; and if there

had been, still there was not one to be found so beautiful. So, the

messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and

had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at

her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his

courtiers, ―May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my

dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole

earth, and you say there must be a queen.‖

When the courtiers heard this, they were shocked, and said, ―Heaven

forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no

good can come.‖ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king

would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ―Before I marry

anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun;

another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be

dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different

kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a

part of his skin.‖ And thus, she though he would think of the matter no

more.

But the king made the most skillful workmen in his kingdom weave the

three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and

a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all

the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and

thus, a mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night

when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden

necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses–of the sun, the

moon, and the stars–up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle

made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then

she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and

journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she

20



was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell

asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs

came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run around and round, and

bark. ―Look sharp!‖ said the king to the huntsmen, ―and see what sort of

game lies there.‖

And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again

said, ―In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we

never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there

it lies fast asleep.‖

―See,‖ said the king, ―if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.‖

So, the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly

frightened, and said, ―I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother

left; have pity on me and take me with you.‖

Then they said, ―Yes, Miss All-Kinds-of-Fur, you will do for the kitchen;

you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.‖

So, they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king‘s palace.

Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of

day ever peeped in, and said, ―All-Kinds-of-Fur, you may lie and sleep

there.‖

She was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow

the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty

work. Thus All-Kinds-of-Fur lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ―Ah!

Princess!‖ thought she, ―what will now become of thee?‖

It happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king‘s castle, so she

said to the cook, ―May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will

take care and stand behind the door.‖

And the cook said, ―Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour‘s

time, to rake out the ashes.‖

21



Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur

skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty

shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her

nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so

went to the feast.

Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she

could be no less than a king‘s daughter. But the king came up to her, and

held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ―I

never saw any one half so beautiful.‖

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked

round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at

the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that

she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face

and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat- skin again. When she

went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook

said, ―Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king‘s soup; I should like

to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don‘t let a hair fall into it,

or you will run a chance of never eating again.‖

As soon as the cook went away, All-Kinds-of-Fur heated the king‘s soup,

and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it

was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring, and

put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the

king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he

thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom, he saw a

gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he

ordered the cook to be sent for.

The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to All-Kinds-

of-Fur, ―You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have

a good beating.‖

Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup.

―I did.‖ answered the cook. But the king said, ―That is not true; it was

better done than you could do it.‖

22



Then he answered, ―To tell the truth I did not cook it, but All-Kinds-of-Fur

did.‖

―Then let All-Kinds-of-Fur come up,‖ said the king: and when she came he

said to her, ―Who are you?‖

―I am a poor child,‖ said she, ―that has lost both father and mother.‖

―How come you in my palace?‖ asked he. ―I am good for nothing,‖ said

she, ―but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my

head.‖

―But how did you get the ring that was in the soup?‖ asked the king. Then

she would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so, the king sent

her away again about her business.

After a time, there was another feast, and All-Kinds-of-Fur asked the cook

to let her go up and see it as before. ―Yes,‖ said he, ―but come again in half

an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.‖

Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress

out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,

looking like a king‘s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at

seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.

After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the

king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin,

and made herself into All-Kinds-of-Fur again, and went into the kitchen to

cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden

necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who

ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so, he sent for the cook, who

was again forced to tell him that All-Kinds-of-Fur had cooked it.

All-Kinds-of-Fur was brought again before the king, but she still told him

that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head. But when

the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened

just the same as before.

23



―You must be a witch, Cat- skin,‖ said the cook; ―for you always put

something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.‘‖

However, he let her go up as before. Then she put on her dress which

sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king

danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as

she did then. So, whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her

finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up

a long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the

hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that

he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin

under the stairs.

But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so,

she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it,

and in her haste, did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of

her fingers white. Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king‘s

soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the

dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered All-Kinds-of-Fur to be

called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had

put on it whilst they were dancing: so, he seized her hand, and kept fast

hold of it, and when she wanted to lose herself and spring away, the fur

cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath

it.

Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and

beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so, she

washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the

most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, ―You

are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.‖

And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was

heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.

Chapter 4 All Kinds of Fur Story



There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was

so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the

earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew

near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you will never

marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and

who has golden hair like mine.‘ Then when the king in his grief promised

all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.

The king was not to be comforted, and for a long time didn‘t think of

taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ―This will not do;

the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.‖ So, messengers

were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.

But there was no princess in the world who had golden hair; and if there

had been, still there was not one to be found so beautiful. So, the

messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and

had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at

her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his

courtiers, ―May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my

dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole

earth, and you say there must be a queen.‖

When the courtiers heard this, they were shocked, and said, ―Heaven

forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no

good can come.‖ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king

would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ―Before I marry

But the king made the most skillful workmen in his kingdom weave the

a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all

thus, a mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night

when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden

necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses–of the sun, the

made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then

she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and

journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she

was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell

asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs

―See,‖ said the king, ―if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.‖

So, the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly

frightened, and said, ―I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother

Then they said, ―Yes, Miss All-Kinds-of-Fur, you will do for the kitchen;

So, they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king‘s palace.

Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of

She was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow

the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty

work. Thus All-Kinds-of-Fur lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ―Ah!

It happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king‘s castle, so she

said to the cook, ―May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will

take care and stand behind the door.‖

And the cook said, ―Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour‘s

Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur

―I did.‖ answered the cook. But the king said, ―That is not true; it was

better done than you could do it.‖

Then he answered, ―To tell the truth I did not cook it, but All-Kinds-of-Fur

did.‖

―Then let All-Kinds-of-Fur come up,‖ said the king: and when she came he

said to her, ―Who are you?‖

28



After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the

king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin,

and made herself into All-Kinds-of-Fur again, and went into the kitchen to

cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden

necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who

ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so, he sent for the cook, who

was again forced to tell him that All-Kinds-of-Fur had cooked it.

All-Kinds-of-Fur was brought again before the king, but she still told him

that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head. But when

the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened

just the same as before.

―You must be a witch, Cat- skin,‖ said the cook; ―for you always put

something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.‘‖

However, he let her go up as before. Then she put on her dress which

sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king

danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as

she did then. So, whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her

finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up

a long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the

hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that

he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin

under the stairs.

But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so,

she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it,

and in her haste, did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of

her fingers white. Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king‘s

soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the

dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered All-Kinds-of-Fur to be

called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had

put on it whilst they were dancing: so, he seized her hand, and kept fast

hold of it, and when she wanted to lose herself and spring away, the fur

29



cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath

it.

Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and

beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so, she

washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the

most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, ―You

are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.‖

And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was

heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.





Chapter 5 Hamon Grizzle Beard Story


Once on a time there was a Princess who was very proud. She thought that

no suitor was good enough for her. She made game of them all, and sent

them about their business, one after the other; but though she was so

proud, still new suitors kept on coming to the palace, for she was a real

beauty!

So, one day there came a prince to woo her, and his name was Hamon

Grizzle beard; but the first night he was there, the Princess told the king‘s

fool to cut off the ears of one of the prince‘s horses, and slit the jaws of the

other up to the ears. When the prince went out to drive next day the

Princess stood in the porch and looked at him.

―Well!‖ she cried, ―I never saw the like of this in all my life; the keen north

wind that blows here has taken the ears off one of your horses, and the

other has stood by and gaped at what was going on till his jaws have split

right up to his ears.‖

And with that she burst out into a roar of laughter, ran in, slammed to the

door, and let him drive off.

30



So, he drove home; but as he went, he thought to himself that he would

pay her off one day. After a bit, he put on a great beard of moss, threw a

great fur cloak over his clothes, and dressed himself up just like any

beggar. He went to a goldsmith and bought a golden spinning wheel, and

sat down with it under the Princess‘ window and began to file at his

spinning wheel, and to turn it this way and that, for it wasn‘t quite in

order.



So, when the Princess rose in the morning, she came to the window and

threw it up, and called out to the beggar if he would sell his golden

spinning wheel?

―No; it isn‘t for sale,‖ said Hamon Grizzle beard; but if I may have leave to

sleep outside your bed-room door to-night, I‘ll give it you.‖

Well, the Princess thought it a good bargain; there could be no danger in

letting him sleep outside her door.

So, she got the wheel, and at night Hamon Grizzlier lay down outside her

bed-room. But as the night wore on he began to freeze.

―Hutetutetutetu! it is so cold; do let me in,‖ he cried.

―You‘ve lost your wits outright, I think,‖ said the Princess.

―Oh, hutetutetutetu! it is so bitter cold, pray do let me in,‖ said Hacon

Grizzlebeard again.

―Hush! hush! hold your tongue!‖ said the Princess; ―if my father were to

know that there was a man in the house, I should be in a fine scrape.‖

―Oh, hutetutetutetu! I‘m almost frozen to death; only let me come inside

and lie on the floor,‖ said Hacon Grizzlebeard.

Yes! there was no help for it. She had to let him in, and when he was, he lay

on the ground and slept like a top.

Sometime after, Hacon came again with the stand to the spinning wheel,

and sat down under the Princess‘ window, and began to file at it, for it was

31



not quite fit for use. When she heard, him filing, she threw up the window

and began to talk to him, and to ask what he had there.

―Oh! only the stand to that spinning wheel which your royal highness

bought; for I thought, as you had the wheel, you might like to have the

stand too.‖

―What do you want for it?‖ asked the Princess; but it was not for sale any

more than the wheel, but she might have them if she would give him leave

to sleep on the floor of her bedroom next night.

Well! she gave him leave, only he was to be sure to lie still, and not to

shiver and call out ―hutted,‖ or any such stuff. Hacon Grizzlebeard

promised fair enough, but as the night wore on he began to shiver and

shake, and to ask whether he might not come nearer, and lie on the floor

alongside the Princess‘ bed.

There was no help for it; she had to give him leave, lest the king should

hear the noise he made. So Hacon Grizzlebeard lay alongside the Princess‘

bed, and slept like a top.

It was a long while before Hacon Grizzlebeard came again; but when he

came he had with him a golden wool-winder, and he sat down and began

to file at it under the Princess‘ window. Then came the old story over

again. When the Princess heard, what was going on, she came to the

window and asked him how he did, and whether he would sell the golden

wool-winder?

―It is not to be had for money; but if you‘ll give me leave to sleep to-night

in your bed-room, with my head on your bedstead, you shall have it for

nothing,‖ said Hacon Grizzlebeard. ―Well! she would give him leave, if he

only gave his word to be quiet and make no noise. So, he said he would do

his best to be still; but as the night wore on he began to shiver and shake, so

that his teeth chattered again.

―Hutetutetutetu! it is so bitter cold! Oh, do let me get into bed and warm

myself a little,‖ said Hacon Grizzlebeard.

―Get into bed!‖ said the Princess; ―why, you must have lost your wits.‖

32



―Hutetutetutetu!‖ said Hacon; ―do let me get into bed. Hutetutetutetu.‖

―Hush! hush! be still for God‘s sake,‖ said the Princess; ―if father knows

there is a man in here, I shall be in a sad plight. I‘m sure he‘ll kill me on the

spot.‖

―Hutetutetutetu! let me get into bed,‖ said Hacon Grizzlebeard, who kept

on shivering so that the whole room shook. Well! there was no help for it;

she had to let him get into bed, where he slept both sound and soft; but a

little while after the Princess had a child, at which the king grew so wild

with rage, that he was near making an end of both mother and babe.

Just after this happened, came Hacon Grizzlebeard tramping that way once

more, as if by chance, and took his seat down in the kitchen, like any other

beggar.

So, when the Princess came out and saw him, she cried, ―Ah, God have

mercy on me, for the ill-luck you have brought on me; father is ready to

burst with rage; do let me follow you to your home.‖

―Oh! I‘ll be bound you‘re too well bred to follow me,‖ said Hacon, ―for I

have nothing, but a log hut to live in; and how I shall ever get food for you

I can‘t tell, for it‘s just as much as I can do to get food for myself.‖

―Oh yes! it‘s all the same to me how you get it, or whether you get it at all,‖

she said; ―only let me be with you, for if I stay here any longer, my father

will be sure to take my life.‖

So, she got leave to be with the beggar, as she called him, and they walked

a long, long way, though she was but a poor hand at tramping. When she

passed out of her father‘s land into another, she asked whose it was?

―Oh! this is Hacon Bristlehead‘s, if you must know,‖ said he.

―Indeed!‖ said the Princess; ―I might have married him if I chose, and then

I should not have had to walk about like a beggar‘s wife.‖

So, whenever they came to grand castles, and woods, and parks, and she

asked whose they were? the beggar‘s answer was still the same: ―Oh! they

are Hacon Bristlehead‘s.‖ And the Princess was in a sad way that she had

33



not chosen the man who had such broad lands. Last of all they came to a

palace, where he said he was known, and where he thought he could get

her work, so that they might have something to live on; so he built up a

cabin by the wood-side for them to dwell in; and every day he went to the

king‘s palace, as he said, to hew wood and draw water for the cook, and

when he came back he brought a few scraps of meat; but they did not go

very far.

One day, when he came home from the palace, he said—

―To-morrow I will stay at home and look after the baby, but you must get

ready to go to the palace, do you hear? for the Prince said you were to

come and try your hand at baking.‖

―I bake!‖ said the Princess; ―I can‘t bake, for I never did such a thing in my

life.‖

―Well, you must go,‖ said Hacon, ―since the Prince has said it. If you can‘t

bake, you can learn; you have only got to look how the rest bake; and

mind, when you leave, you must steal me some bread.‖

―I can‘t steal,‖ said the Princess.

―You can learn that too,‖ said Hacon; you know we live on short commons.

But take care that the Prince doesn‘t see you, for he has eyes at the back of

his head.‖

So, when she was well on her way, Hacon ran by a short cut and reached

the palace long before her, and threw off his rags and beard, and put on his

princely robes.

The Princess took her turn in the backhouse, and did as Hacon bade her,

for she stole bread till her pockets were crammed full. So, when she was

about to go home at even, the Prince said—

―We don‘t know much of this old wife of Hacon Bristlehead‘s; I think we‘d

best see if she has taken anything away with her.‖

34



So, he thrust his hand into all her pockets, and felt her all over, and when

he found the bread, he was in a great rage, and led them all a sad life. She

began to weep and bewail, and said—

―The beggar made me do it, and I couldn‘t help it.‖

―Well,‖ said the Prince at last, ―it ought to have gone hard with you; but all

the same, for the sake of the beggar you shall be forgiven this once.‖

When she was well on her way, he threw off his robes, put on his skin

cloak, and his false beard, and reached the cabin before her. When she

came home, he was busy nursing the baby.

―Well, you have made me do what it went against my heart to do. This is

the first time I ever stole, and this shall be the last;‖ and with that she told

him how it had gone with her, and what the Prince had said.

A few days after Hacon Grizzlebeard came home at even and said—

―To-morrow I must stay at home and mind the babe, for they are going to

kill a pig at the palace, and you must help to make the sausages.‖

―I make sausages!‖ said the Princess; ―I can‘t do any such thing. I have

eaten sausages often enough; but as to making them, I never made one in

my life.‖

Well, there was no help for it; the Prince had said it, and go she must. As

for not knowing how, she was only to do what the others did, and at the

same time Hacon bade her steal some sausages for him.

―Nay, but I can‘t steal them,‖ she said; ―you know how it went last time.‖

―Well, you can learn to steal; who knows but you may have better luck

next time?‖ said Hacon Grizzlebeard.

When she was well on her way, Hacon ran by a short cut, reached the

palace long before her, threw off his skin cloak and false beard, and stood

in the kitchen with his royal robes before she came in. So, the Princess

stood by when the pig was killed, and made sausages with the rest, and

35



did as Hacon bade her, and stuffed her pockets full of sausages. But when

she was about to go home at even, the Prince said—

―This beggar‘s wife was long-fingered last time; we may as well just see if

she hasn‘t carried anything off.‖

So, he began to thrust his hands into her pockets, and when he found the

sausages he was in a great rage again, and made a great to do, threatening

to send for the constable and put her into the cage.

―Oh, God bless your royal highness; do let me off! The beggar made me do

it,‖ she said, and wept bitterly.

―Well,‖ said Hacon, ―you ought to smart for it; but for the beggar‘s sake

you shall be forgiven.‖

When she was gone, he changed his clothes again, ran by the short cut, and

when she reached the cabin, there he was before her. Then she told him the

whole story, and swore, through thick and thin, it should be the last time

he got her to do such a thing.

Now, it fell out a little time after, when the man came back from the palace,

he said—

―Our Prince is going to be married, but the bride is sick, so the tailor can‘t

measure her for her wedding gown. And the Prince‘s will be, that you

should go up to the palace and be measured instead of the bride; for he

says you are just the same height and shape. But after you have been

measured, mind you don‘t go away; you can stand about, you know, and

when the tailor cuts out the gown, you can snap up the largest pieces, and

bring them home for a waistcoat for me.‖

―Nay, but I can‘t steal,‖ she said; ―besides, you know how it went last

time.‖

―You can learn then,‖ said Hacon, ―and you may have better luck,

perhaps.‖

She thought it bad, but still she went and did as she was told. She stood by

while the tailor was cutting out the gown, and she swept down all the

36



biggest scraps, and stuffed them into her pockets; and when she was going

away, the Prince said—

―We may as well see if this old girl has not been long-fingered this time

too.‖

So, he began to feel and search her pockets, and when he found the pieces

he was in a rage, and began to stamp and scold at a great rate, while she

wept and said—

―Ah, pray forgive me; the beggar bade me do it, and I couldn‘t help it.‖

―Well, you ought to smart for it,‖ said Hacon; ―but for the beggar‘s sake it

shall be forgiven you.‖

So, it went now just as it had gone before, and when she got back to the

cabin, the beggar was there before her.

―Oh, Heaven help me,‖ she said; ―you will be the death of me at last by

making me nothing but what is wicked. The Prince was in such a towering

rage that he threatened me both with the constable and cage.‖

Sometime after, Hacon came home to the cabin at even and said—

―Now, the Prince‘s will be, that you should go up to the palace and stand

for the bride, old lass! for the bride is still sick, and keeps her bed; but he

won‘t put off the wedding; and he says, you are so like her, that no one

could tell one from the other; so, too-morrow you must get ready to go to

the palace.‖

―I think you‘ve lost your wits, both the Prince and you,‖ said she. ―Do you

think I look fit to stand in the bride‘s place? look at me! Can any beggar‘s

troll look worse than I?‖

―Well, the prince said you were to go, and so go you must,‖ said Hacon

Grizzlebeard.

There was no help for it, go she must; and when, she reached the palace,

they dressed her out so finely that no princess ever looked so smart.

37



The bridal train went to church, where she stood for the bride, and when

they came back, there was dancing and merriment in the palace. But just as

she was during dancing with the Prince, she saw a gleam of light through

the window, and lo! the cabin by the wood-side was all one bright flame.

―Oh! the beggar, and the babe, and the cabin,‖ she screamed out, and was

just going to run towards the cabin.

―I am the beggar, and here is the babe, and so let the cabin burn away,‖

said Hacon Grizzlebeard.

The princess recognized that Hacon Grizzlebeard was the beggar! They

two married in merriment and lived happily ever after.





Chapter 6 Count Silver Nose Story


One upon a time the Devil decided that he needed a wife. He disguised

himself as a nobleman and journeyed in the forest until he came to small

cottage. The cottage was inhabited by a widowed washerwoman who had

three beautiful daughters. The devil told the widow that he was a rich

nobleman who would like to marry her eldest daughter. Although the

widow was poor and felt that her daughters would benefit from marrying

a wealthy man, she distrusted the man‘s strange nose which was unusually

long and silver colored.

Her eldest daughter was more than happy to marry the wealthy man as

she was bored with her life at home and wanted to find adventure. She

thought the man was very well dressed and was excited about an enjoying

a new life with him. Like her mother, she thought the man‘s nose was

unusual too, and secretly she called him ―Silver nose‖. Her mother, unable

to convince her daughter otherwise reluctantly agreed to her marrying the

man.

38



The eldest daughter followed Silver nose to his magnificent palace. The

man was indeed even wealthier than she had ever imagined. The palace

was adorned with jewels and the land was so vast there seemed to be no

end to it. They were married for less than a month when one day Silver

nose told his wife that he had to go on a business trip. He provided hers

with keys to all the fine rooms in the palace and instructed that she should

see and enjoy them all except one door which she must not unlock. That

night, Silver nose left a rose in his wife‘s hair.

The eldest daughter was a curious one and the first thing she did in the

morning was to impatiently open the forbidden door. Oh, but she was

horrified at what she saw! it was like hell itself behind the door, fire

engulfed the room and damned souls screamed at her for help. The

frightened girl ran out of the room and slammed the door shut but in her

hurry a tongue of fire had scorched the rose she wore in her hair.

Silver nose returned the next day and asked his wife for the keys back. The

eldest daughter was so shaken that he guessed immediately what she had

done. He noticed that the flower was gone and that was proof that she

entered the forbidden room. ―The flower from your hair is gone! you

disobeyed me!‖ he shouted. He dragged the girl toward the forbidden

room and tossed her in.

Many months passed and Silver nose grew tired of living by himself. He

decided that he needed a wife and returned to the washerwoman and

asked for her second daughter. The widow asked Silver nose: ―What

happened to my eldest daughter whom you married?‖

Silver nose replied: ―She is so happy with her new life that she wants her

sisters to share it with her‖

The washerwoman saw that the man‘s nose was more silver than before

and she did not believe what he said, she was sure that something horrible

had befallen her eldest daughter. But the second daughter had always been

secretly jealous of her sister‘s marriage to the wealthy noble man and she

jumped at the opportunity to have that life for herself as well.

39



The second daughter married Silver nose and followed him to his palace. A

month passed and although she never saw her sister, the jewels and pretty

dresses she adorned herself with made her forget about the eldest

daughter. One day Silver nose told his wife that he needed to leave on a

business trip and he gave her all the keys to his fine rooms. He again,

warned that she must not open the forbidden room. At night, Silver nose

placed a rose in his wife‘s hair.

However, the second daughter was just as curious as the eldest, she

opened the forbidden door then next morning and saw hell in the room.

She was instantly assailed by smoke, flames, and howls of the damned

souls, in whose midst she spotted her sister. ―Sister, free me from this

Hell!‖ screamed the first girl. But the second daughter was so afraid that

she slammed the door and ran. When Silver nose returned the palace, he

saw that her flower was withered from her hair and so the second daughter

met the same fate as her sisters and was pushed into the room of hell.

Months passed and Silver nose wanted a wife again. He went back to the

widow who by now was very fearful of him. She told the youngest

daughter:

―My beautiful daughter, I cannot let you marry this man, there is

something not right about him and I cannot lose you too!‖

The youngest daughter however was cleverer than her sisters, she told her

mother to not worry and promised that she would be safe.

A month after she married to the Silver nose, Silver nose had to go on a

business trip. Like her sisters, she was given the keys to the rooms and

forbidden to enter one door. At night, the devil put a rose in her hair.

The first thing Lucia did when she got up next morning was arrange her

hair. Looking in the mirror, she noticed the Rose. ―Well, well!‖ she said.

―Silver Nose pinned a Rose on me. How thoughtful of him! Who knows

why he did it? In any case, I‘ll keep it fresh.‖ She put it into a glass of

water, combed her hair, then said, ―Now let‘s look at that mysterious

door.‖

40



She just barely opened it, and out rushed a flame. She glimpsed countless

people burning, and there in the middle of the crowd were her big sisters.

―Lucia! Lucia!‖ they screamed. ―Get us out of here! Save us!‖

At once Lucia shut the door tightly and began thinking how she might

rescue her sisters.

By the time the Devil got home, Lucia had put her Rose back in her hair,

and acted as though nothing had happened that day. Silver Nose looked at

the Rose. ―Oh, it‘s still fresh,‖ he said.

―Of course, why shouldn‘t it be? Why would anyone wear withered

flowers in her hair?‖

―Oh, I was just wondering my dear,‖ answered Silver Nose. ―You seem like

a clever girl. Keep it up, and we‘ll never quarrel.?‖

It not long before Silver nose grew to love the Lucia for he thought she

obeyed him very well. One day however, he saw that she was sighing

looking sad.

―Why do you look so sad my dear? are you not happy?‖ He asked.

―Yes, but I‘d be happier if I didn‘t have something bothering me.‖ She

replied.

―What‘s bothering you?‖

―When I left my mother, she wasn‘t feeling too well. Now I have no news

at all of her.‖

―If that‘s all you‘re worried about,‖ said the Devil, ―I‘ll drop by her house

and see how she‘s doing.‖

―Thank you, that is very kind of you. If you can go tomorrow, I‘ll get up a

bag of laundry at once which my mother can wash if she is well enough.

The bag won‘t be too heavy for you, will it?‖

―Of course, not. I can carry anything under the sun, no matter how heavy it

is.‖

41



When the Devil went out again that day, Lucia opened the door to Hell,

pulled out her oldest sister, and tied her up in a bag. ―Keep still in there,‖

she told her. ―The Devil himself will carry you back home. But any time he

so much as thinks of putting the bag down, you must say, ‗I see you, I see

you!‘‖

The Devil returned, and Lucia said, ―Here is the bag of things to be

washed. Do you promise you‘ll take it straight to my mother?‖

―You don‘t trust me?‖ asked the Devil.

―Certainly, I trust you, more so with my special ability to see from a great

distance away. If you dare put the bag down somewhere, I‘ll see you.‖

―Yes, of course,‖ said the Devil, but he had little faith in her claim of being

able to see things a great distance away. He flung the bag over his

shoulder. ―My goodness, this dirty stuff is heavy!‖ he exclaimed.

―Naturally!‖ replied the girl. ―How many years has it been since you had

anything washed?‖

Silver Nose set out for the washerwoman‘s, but when he was only halfway

there, he said to himself, ―Maybe…but I shall see if this girl isn‘t emptying

my house of everything I own, under the pretext of sending out laundry.‖

He went to put the bag down and open it.

―I see you, I see you!‖ suddenly screamed the sister inside the bag.

―By Jove, it‘s true! She can see from afar!‖ exclaimed Silver Nose. He threw

the bag back over his shoulder and marched straight to Lucia‘s mother‘s

house. ―Your daughter sends you this stuff to wash and wants to know

how you are…‖

As soon as he left, the washerwoman opened the sack, and you can

imagine her joy upon finding her oldest daughter inside.

A week later, Lucia pretended to be sad once more and told Silver Nose

she wanted news of her mother.

42



She sent him to her house with another bag of laundry. So, Silver Nose

carried off the second sister, without managing to peep inside because of

the ―I see you, I see you!‖ which came from the bag the instant he started to

open it. The washerwoman, who now knew Silver Nose was the Devil, was

quite frightened when he returned, for she was sure he would ask for the

clean wash from last time. But Silver Nose put down the new bag and said,

―I‘ll get the clean wash some other time. This heavy bag has broken my

back, and I want to go home with nothing to carry.‖

When he had gone, the washerwoman anxiously opened the bag and

embraced her second daughter. But she was more worried than ever about

Lucia, who was now alone in the Devil‘s hands.

What did Lucia do? Not long afterward she started up again about news of

her mother. By now the Devil was sick and tired of carrying laundry, but

he had grown too fond of this obedient girl to say no to her. As soon as it

grew dark, Lucia announced she had a bad headache and would go to bed

early. ―I‘ll prepare the laundry and leave the bag out for you, so if I don‘t

feel like getting up in the morning, you can be on your way.‖

Now Lucia had made a rag doll the same size as herself. She put it in bed

under the covers, cut off her own braids, and sewed them on the doll‘s

head. the doll then looked like Lucia asleep, and Lucia closed herself up in

the bag.

In the morning, the Devil saw the girl snuggled down under the covers and

set out with the bag over his shoulder. ―She‘s sick this morning,‖ he said to

himself, ―and won‘t be looking. It‘s the perfect time to see if this really is

nothing but laundry.‖ At that, he put the bag down and was about to open

it. ―I see you, I see you!‖ cried Lucia.

―By Jove, it‘s her voice to a tee, as though she were right here!‖ He took up

the bag again and carried it to the washerwoman. ―I‘ll come back later for

everything,‖ he said rapidly. ―I have to get home right away because Lucia

is sick.‖

So, the family was finally reunited. Since Lucia had also carried off great

sums of the Devil‘s money, they were now able to live in comfort and

43



happiness. They planted a cross before the door, and from then on, the

Devil kept his distance.





Chapter 7 Blue Beard Story


Once upon a time there lived a man who owned splendid town and

country houses, gold and silver plate, tapestries and coach‘s gilt all over.

But the poor fellow had a blue beard, and this made him so frightfully ugly

that none of the ladies in the neighborhood would venture to go into his

company. Amongst his neighbors was a lady of high degree who had two

extremely beautiful daughters. He asked for the hand of one of these in

marriage, leaving it to their mother to choose which daughter should be

bestowed upon him. Both girls, however, raised objections, and his offer

was bandied from one to the other, neither being able to bring herself to

accept a man with a blue beard. Another reason for their distaste was the

fact that he had already married several wives, and no one knew what had

become of them.

In order that they might become better acquainted, Blue Beard invited the

two girls, with their mother and three or four of their best friends, to meet a

party of young men from the neighborhood at one of his country houses.

Here they spent eight whole days, and throughout their stay there was a

constant round of picnics, hunting and fishing expeditions, dances,

dinners, and luncheons. They never slept, but spent the night playing

merry pranks upon each other. In short, the time passed so agreeably that

the younger daughter began to think the master of the house had not so

very blue a beard after all, and that he was in fact an exceedingly agreeable

man. As soon as the party returned to town, she accepted Blue Beard‘s

proposal of marriage.

About a month after the marriage had taken place, Blue Beard informed his

wife that he had to leave her for a few weeks, as he had some business to

do in a distant country. He begged her to amuse herself well during his

absence, and suggested that she should invite some of her friends and take

44



them, if she liked, to the country. ―Here,‖ he said, ―are the keys to the two

large storerooms, and here is the key to the strongboxes where my gold

and silver is kept. This key is to the caskets containing my jewels, and this

one is the master key, which gives admittance to all the apartments—but

this small key belongs to the door of the closet at the end of the long gallery

on the ground floor. You may open everything, you may go everywhere,

but I forbid you to enter this little room. Should you disobey me, expect the

most dreadful of punishments.‖ She promised to follow these instructions

in the most faithful

manner and, after embracing her, Blue Beard stepped into his coach and

proceeded on his journey.

The friends of the bride could not wait to be invited, so impatient were

they to see all the riches and magnificence she had gained by her marriage.

They had not dared to venture while her husband was there, for his blue

beard frightened them so. No sooner had they arrived than they ran

impatiently from room to room, and from wardrobe to wardrobe, declaring

that the last was still richer and more beautiful than that which they had

seen the moment before. There were mirrors in which they could view

themselves from top to toe, some with frames of plate glass, others with

frames of silver and gilt lacquer. They were the most superb and beautiful

objects that they had ever seen.

In short, nothing could exceed the magnificence of what they saw, and the

visitors did not cease to extol and envy the good fortune of their friend,

who in the meantime was far from being amused by their fine

compliments. In fact, so great indeed was her curiosity about the

mysterious closet that, forgetting how impolite it would be to leave her

guests, she descended a private staircase that led to the room. She was in

such a hurry that she was two or three times in danger of breaking her

neck. When she reached the door of the closet, she paused for a while,

thinking of the orders her husband had given her, and reflecting what

harm might come to her because of her disobedience. But she was so very

curious to know what was inside, that she decided to venture in. With a

45



trembling hand, she put the key into the lock, and the door opened

immediately.

The window shutters being closed, she at first saw nothing; but in a short

time, she saw that the floor was covered with dried blood, on which the

bodies of several dead women lay. These were all the wives whom Blue

Beard had married and murdered, one after another. She thought that she

should have died of fear, and the key of the closet door, which she held in

her hand, fell to the floor.

When she had somewhat regained her senses, she picked up the key,

closed the door, and went upstairs to her chamber to compose herself a

little. But this she could not do, for her nerves were too shaken. Having

observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or

three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not disappear. In vain did

she wash it and scrub it, but the blood remained, for the key was

bewitched, and she could never make it clean; when the blood was wiped

from one side, it appeared again on the other.

That very same evening, Blue Beard returned from his journey. He had

received some letters on the way, he said, informing him that the affair he

went about was finished to his advantage. His wife did everything she

could to make it appear that she was delighted by his speedy return. The

next day he asked for the keys, which his wife returned, but with such a

trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened. ―‗How is it,‖ he

said, ―that the key of the little closet is not here amongst the rest?‖ ―I must

have left it upstairs upon my dressing table,‖ she said. ―Be sure to give it to

me later.‖ said Blue Beard. After going several times backwards and

forward, pretending to look for the key, she was at last obliged to give it to

Blue Beard. He looked at it attentively, and then asked, ―How came the

blood upon this key?‖ ―I‘m sure I do not know,‖ replied the poor wife,

paler than death. ―You do not know?‖ exclaimed Blue Beard, ―I know well

enough. You entered the closet on the ground floor! Very well, Madame,

enter it you shall—you shall go and take your place among the ladies you

saw there!‖

46



Upon this she threw herself at her husband‘s feet, begging his pardon with

tears for her disobedience. She would have melted any heart, so beautiful

and sorrowful was she, but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any stone.

―You must die, Madame,‖ he said, ―and at once.‖ ―Since I must die,‖ she

replied, gazing at him with eyes that were bathed in tears, ―allow me at

least a little time to say my prayers.‖ ―I give you one quarter of an hour,‖

replied Blue Beard, ―but not a moment longer.‖

When the poor girl was left alone, she called her sister to her and said:

―Sister Anne,‖ (for that was her name), ―go up, I implore you, to the top of

the tower, and see if my brothers are yet in sight, for they promised to

come and visit me today. If you see them, make signs to them to hasten.‖

Her sister did as she was asked, and the poor unhappy girl cried out to her

from time to time, ―Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?‖ and

her sister replied, ―I see naught but the dust in the sun and the grass that

grows green.‖

Presently, Blue Beard, grasping a great cutlass, cried out at the top of his

voice, ―Come down instantly, or I shall come and fetch you.‖ ―Oh please,

one moment more,‖ called out his wife, and again called softly to her sister,

―Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?‖ ―I see naught but the dust

in the sun and the grass that grows green,‖ replied her sister. ―Come down

at once, I say,‖ shouted Blue Beard, ―or I will come upstairs myself.‖ ―I am

coming,‖ replied his wife. Then she called again to her sister, ―Anne, sister

Anne, do you see anyone coming?‖ ―I see,‖ replied her sister, ―a great

cloud of dust which comes this way.‖ ―Is it my brothers?‖ ―Alas, sister, no;

it is but a flock of sheep.‖

―Do you refuse to come down?‖ roared Blue Beard. ―One little moment

more,‖ exclaimed his wife. Once more she cried, ―Anne, sister Anne, do

you see anyone coming?‖ ―I see,‖ replied her sister, ―two men on

horseback coming this way, but they are still at a great distance.‖ ―Heaven

be praised!‖ she exclaimed a moment later, ―They are my brothers! I am

signaling to them all I can to hasten.‖

47



Blue Beard let forth so mighty a roar that the whole house shook. The poor

wife went down and threw herself at his feet, in tears. ―That avails you

nothing,‖ said Blue Beard, ―you must die.‖ Seizing her by the hair with one

hand, and holding the cutlass with the other, Blue Beard prepared to cut off

her head. The poor girl, turning towards him, begged for a moment in

which to collect her thoughts. ―No! No!‖ cried Blue Beard, ―I will give you

no more time. Commend your soul to Heaven.‖ Again, he raised his arm.

At this very moment, there came so loud a knocking at the gate that Blue

Beard stopped short. The gate was opened, two horsemen entered, drew

their swords, and rode straight at Blue Beard. He recognized them as the

brothers of his wife, and fled instantly to save himself. But the two brothers

were so close upon him that they caught him before he had gone twenty

steps. They plunged their swords into his body, and Blue Beard fell down

dead at their feet.

The poor wife, who was nearly as dead as her husband, had not the

strength to rise and embrace her brothers. It was found that Blue Beard had

no heirs, so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She gave some of her

vast fortune in a marriage dowry to her sister Anne, who soon after became

the wife of a young gentleman who had been in love with her for a long

time. Another part she used to buy commissions for each of her brothers.

The rest formed a dowry for her own marriage with a very worthy man,

whose kind treatment soon made her forget Blue Beard‘s cruelty.





Chapter 8 Donkey Skin Story





There was once upon a time a king who was so much loved by his subjects

that he thought himself the happiest man in the whole world, and he had

everything his heart could desire. His palace was filled with the rarest of

curiosities, and his gardens with the sweetest flowers, while in the marble

stalls of his stables stood a row of milk-white Arabs, with big brown eyes.

48



Strangers who had heard of the marvels which the king had collected, and

made long journeys to see them, were, however, surprised to find the most

splendid stall of all occupied by a donkey, with particularly large and

drooping ears. It was a very fine donkey; but still, as far as they could tell,

nothing so very remarkable as to account for the care with which it was

lodged; and they went away wondering, for they could not know that

every night, when it was asleep, bushels of gold pieces tumbled out of its

ears, which were picked up each morning by the attendants.

After many years of prosperity, a sudden blow fell upon the king in the

death of his wife, whom he loved dearly. But before she died, the queen,

who had always thought first of his happiness, gathered all her strength,

and said to him:

‗Promise me one thing: you must marry again, I know, for the good of your

people, as well as of yourself. But do not set about it in a hurry. Wait until

you have found a woman more beautiful and better formed than myself.‘

‗Oh, do not speak to me of marrying,‘ sobbed the king; ‗rather let me die

with you!‘ But the queen only smiled faintly, and turned over on her pillow

and died.

For some months, the king‘s grief was great; then gradually he began to

forget a little, and, besides, his counselors were always urging him to seek

another wife. At first, he refused to listen to them, but by-and-by he

allowed himself to be persuaded to think of it, only stipulating that the

bride should be more beautiful and attractive than the late queen, per the

promise he had made her.

Overjoyed at having obtained what they wanted, the counselors sent

envoys far and wide to get portraits of all the most famous beauties of

every country. The artists were very busy and did their best, but, alas!

nobody could even pretend that any of the ladies could compare for a

moment with the late queen.

At length, one day, when he had turned away discouraged from a fresh

collection of pictures, the king‘s eyes fell on his adopted daughter, who had

lived in the palace since she was a baby, and he saw that, if a woman

49



existed on the whole earth more lovely than the queen, this was she! He at

once made known what his wishes were, but the young girl, who was not

at all ambitious, and had not the faintest desire to marry him, was filled

with dismay, and begged for time to think about it. That night, when

everyone was asleep, she started in a little car drawn by a big sheep, and

went to consult her fairy godmother.

‗I know what you have come to tell me,‘ said the fairy, when the maiden

stepped out of the car; ‗and if you don‘t wish to marry him, I will show you

how to avoid it. Ask him to give you a dress that exactly matches the sky. It

will be impossible for him to get one, so you will be quite safe.‘ The girl

thanked the fairy and returned home again.

The next morning, when her father (as she had always called him) came to

see her, she told him that she could give him no answer until he had

presented her with a dress the color of the sky. The king, overjoyed at this

answer, sent for all the choicest weavers and dressmakers in the kingdom,

and commanded them to make a robe the color of the sky without an

instant‘s delay, or he would cut off their heads at once. Dreadfully

frightened at this threat, they all began to dye and cut and sew, and in two

days they brought back the dress, which looked as if it had been cut

straight out of the heavens! The poor girl was thunderstruck, and did not

know what to do; so, in the night she harnessed her sheep again, and went

in search of her godmother.

‗The king is cleverer than I thought,‘ said the fairy; ‗but tell him you must

have a dress of moonbeams.‘

And the next day, when the king summoned her into his presence, the girl

told him what she wanted.

‗Madam, I can refuse you nothing,‘ said he; and he ordered the dress to be

ready in twenty-four hours, or every man should be hanged.

They set to work with all their might, and by dawn next day, the dress of

moonbeams was laid across her bed. The girl, though she could not help

admiring its beauty, began to cry, till the fairy, who heard her, came to her

help.

50



Well, I could not have believed it of him!‘ said she; ‗but ask for a dress of

sunshine, and I shall be surprised indeed if he manages that!‘

The goddaughter did not feel much faith in the fairy after her two previous

failures; but not knowing what else to do, she told her father what she was

told.

The king made no difficulties about it, and even gave his finest rubies and

diamonds to ornament the dress, which was so dazzling, when finished,

that it could only be looked through smoked glasses!

When the princess saw it, she pretended that the sight hurt her eyes, and

retired to her room, where she found the fairy awaiting her, very much

ashamed of herself.

‗There is only one thing to be done now,‘ cried she; ‗you must demand the

skin of the ass he treasures by. It is from that donkey he obtains all his vast

riches, and I am sure he will never give it to you.‘

The princess was not so certain; however, she went to the king, and told

him she could never marry him till he had given her the ass‘s skin.

The king was both astonished and grieved at this new request, but did not

hesitate an instant. The ass was sacrificed, and the skin laid at the feet of

the princess.

The poor girl, seeing no escape from the fate she dreaded, wept afresh, and

tore her hair; when, suddenly, the fairy stood before her.

Take heart,‘ she said, ‗all will now go well! Wrap yourself in this skin, and

leave the palace and go as far as you can. I will look after you. Your dresses

and your jewels shall follow you underground, and if you strike the earth

whenever you need anything, you will have it at once. But go quickly: you

have no time to lose.‘

So, the princess clothed herself in the ass‘s skin, and slipped from the

palace without being seen by anyone.

Directly she was missed there was a great hue and cry, and every corner,

possible and impossible, was searched. Then the king sent out parties along

51



all the roads, but the fairy threw her invisible mantle over the girl when

they approached, and none of them could see her.

The princess walked on a long, long way, trying to find someone who

would take her in, and let her work for them; but though the cottagers,

whose houses she passed, gave her food from charity, the ass‘s skin was so

dirty they would not allow her to enter their houses. For her flight, had

been so hurried she had had no time to clean it.

Tired and disheartened at her ill-fortune, she was wandering, one day, past

the gate of a farmyard, situated just outside the walls of a large town, when

she heard a voice calling to her. She turned and saw the farmer‘s wife

standing among her turkeys, and making signs to her to come in.

‗I want a girl to wash the dishes and feed the turkeys, and clean out the

pig-sty,‘ said the women, ‗and, to judge by your dirty clothes, you would

not be too fine for the work.‘

The girl accepted her offer with joy, and she was at once set to work in a

corner of the kitchen, where all the farm servants came and made fun of

her, and the ass‘s skin in which she was wrapped. But by-and-by they got

so used to the sight of it that it ceased to amuse them, and she worked so

hard and so well, that her mistress grew quite fond of her. And she was so

clever at keeping sheep and herding turkeys that you would have thought

she had done nothing else during her whole life!

One day she was sitting on the banks of a stream bewailing her wretched

lot, when she suddenly caught sight of herself in the water. Her hair and

part of her face was quite concealed by the ass‘s head, which was drawn

right over like a hood, and the filthy matted skin covered her whole body.

It was the first time she had seen herself as other people saw her, and she

was filled with shame at the spectacle. Then she threw off her disguise and

jumped into the water, plunging in again and again, till she shone like

ivory. When it was time to go back to the farm, she was forced to put on

the skin which disguised her, and now seemed more dirty than ever; but,

as she did so, she comforted herself with the thought that to-morrow was a

52



holiday, and that she would be able for a few hours to forget that she was a

farm girl, and be a princess once more.

So, at break of day, she stamped on the ground, as the fairy had told her,

and instantly the dress like the sky lay across her tiny bed. Her room was

so small that there was no place for the train of her dress to spread itself

out, but she pinned it up carefully when she combed her beautiful hair and

piled it up on the top of her head, as she had always worn it. When she had

done, she was so pleased with herself that she determined never to let a

chance pass of putting on her splendid clothes, even if she had to wear

them in the fields, with no one to admire her but the sheep and turkeys.

Now the farm was a royal farm, and, one holiday, when ‗Donkey Skin‘ (as

they had nicknamed the princess) had locked the door of her room and

clothed herself in her dress of sunshine, the king‘s son rode through the

gate, and asked if he might come and rest himself a little after hunting.

Some food and milk were set before him in the garden, and when he felt

rested he got up, and began to explore the house, which was famous

throughout the whole kingdom for its age and beauty. He opened one door

after the other, admiring the old rooms, when he came to a handle that

would not turn. He stooped and peeped through the keyhole to see what

was inside, and was greatly astonished at beholding a beautiful girl, clad in

a dress so dazzling that he could hardly look at it.

The dark gallery seemed darker than ever as he turned away, but he went

back to the kitchen and inquired who slept in the room at the end of the

passage. The scullery maid, they told him, whom everybody laughed at,

and called ‗Donkey Skin;‘ and though he perceived there was some strange

mystery about this, he saw quite clearly there was nothing to be gained by

asking any more questions. So, he rode back to the palace, his head filled

with the vision he had seen through the keyhole.

All night long he tossed about, and awoke the next morning in a high

fever. The queen, who had no other child, and lived in a state of perpetual

anxiety about this one, at once gave him up for lost, and indeed his sudden

illness puzzled the greatest doctors, who tried the usual remedies in vain.

53



At last they told the queen that some secret sorrow must be at the bottom

of all this, and she threw herself on her knees beside her son‘s bed, and

implored him to confide his trouble to her. If it was ambition to be king, his

father would gladly resign the cares of the crown, and suffer him to reign

in his stead; or, if it was love, everything should be sacrificed to get for him

the wife he desired, even if she were daughter of a king with whom the

country was at war at present!

‗Madam,‘ replied the prince, whose weakness would hardly allow him to

speak, ‗do not think me so unnatural as to wish to deprive my father of his

crown. If he lives I shall remain the most faithful of his subjects! And as to

the princesses you speak of, I have seen none that I should care for as a

wife, though I would always obey your wishes, whatever it might cost me.‘

‗Ah! my son,‘ cried she, ‗we will do anything in the world to save your life

—-and ours too, for if you die, we shall die also.‘

‗Well, then,‘ replied the prince, ‗I will tell you the only thing that will cure

me —a cake made by the hand of ―Donkey Skin.‖ ‗

‗Donkey Skin?‘ exclaimed the queen, who thought her son had gone mad;

‗and who or what is that?‘

‗Madam,‘ answered one of the attendants present, who had been with the

prince at the farm, ‗‖ Donkey Skin‖ is, next to the wolf, the most disgusting

creature on the face of the earth. She is a girl who wears a black, greasy

skin, and lives at your farmer‘s as hen-wife.‘

‗Never mind,‘ said the queen; ‗my son seems to have eaten some of her

pastry. It is the whim of a sick man, no doubt; but send at once and let her

bake a cake.‘

The attendant bowed and ordered a page to ride with the message.

Now it is by no means certain that ‗Donkey Skin‘ had not caught a glimpse

of the prince, either when his eyes looked through the keyhole, or else from

her little window, which was over the road. But whether she had seen him

or only heard him spoken of, directly she received the queen‘s command,

she flung off the dirty skin, washed herself from head to foot, and put on a

54



skirt and bodice of shining silver. Then, locking herself into her room, she

took the richest cream, the finest flour, and the freshest eggs on the farm,

and set about making her cake.

As she was stirring the mixture in the saucepan a ring that she sometimes

wore in secret slipped from her finger and fell into the dough. Perhaps

‗Donkey Skin‘ saw it, or perhaps she did not; but, anyway, she went on

stirring, and soon the cake was ready to be put in the oven. When it was

nice and brown, she took off her dress and put on her dirty skin, and gave

the cake to the page, asking at the same time for news of the prince. But the

page turned his head aside, and would not even condescend to answer.

The page rode like the wind, and as soon as he arrived at the palace he

snatched up a silver tray and hastened to present the cake to the prince.

The sick man began to eat it so fast that the doctors thought he would

choke; and, indeed, he very nearly did, for the ring was in one of the bits

which he broke off, though he managed to extract it from his mouth

without anyone seeing him.

The moment the prince was left alone he drew the ring from under his

pillow and kissed it a thousand times. Then he set his mind to find how he

was to see the owner—for even he did not dare to confess that he had only

beheld ‗Donkey Skin‘ through a keyhole, lest they should laugh at this

sudden passion. All this worry brought back the fever, which the arrival of

the cake had diminished for the time; and the doctors, not knowing what

else to say, informed the queen that her son was simply dying of love. The

queen, stricken with horror, rushed into the king‘s presence with the news,

and together they hastened to their son‘s bedside.

‗My boy, my dear boy!‘ cried the king, ‗who is it you want to marry? We

will give her to you for a bride; even if she is the humblest of our slaves.

What is there in the whole world that we would not do for you?‘

The prince, moved to tears at these words, drew the ring, which was an

emerald of the purest water, from under his pillow.

55



‗Ah, dear father and mother, let this be a proof that she whom I love is no

peasant girl. The finger which that ring fits has never been thickened by

hard work. But be her condition what it may, I will marry no other.‘

The king and queen examined the tiny ring very closely, and agreed, with

their son, that the wearer could be no mere farm girl. Then the king went

out and ordered heralds and trumpeters to go through the town,

summoning every maiden to the palace. And she whom the ring fitted

would someday be queen.

First came all the princesses, then all the duchesses‘ daughters, and so on,

in proper order. But not one of them could slip the ring over the tip of her

finger, to the great joy of the prince, whom excitement was fast curing. At

last, when the high-born damsels had failed, the shop girls and

chambermaids took their turn; but with no better fortune.

‗Call in the scullions and shepherdesses,‘ commanded the prince; but the

sight of their fat, red fingers satisfied everybody.

‗There is not a woman left, your Highness,‘ said the chamberlain; but the

prince waved him aside.

‗Have you sent for ―Donkey Skin,‖ who made me the cake?‘ asked he, and

the courtiers began to laugh, and replied that they would not have dared to

introduce so dirty a creature into the palace.

‗Let someone go for her at once,‘ ordered the king. ‗I commanded the

presence of every maiden, high or low, and I meant it.‘

The princess had heard the trumpets and the proclamations, and knew

quite well that her ring was at the bottom of it all. She, too, had fallen in

love with the prince in the brief glimpse she had had of him, and trembled

with fear lest someone else‘s finger might be as small as her own. When,

therefore, the messenger from the palace rode up to the gate, she was

nearly beside herself with delight. Hoping all the time for such a summons,

she had dressed herself with great care, putting on the garment of

moonlight, whose skirt was scattered over with emeralds. But when they

began calling to her to come down, she hastily covered herself with her

56



donkey-skin and announced she was ready to present herself before his

Highness. She was taken straight into the hall, where the prince was

awaiting her, but at the sight of the donkey-skin his heart sank. Had he

been mistaken after all?

‗Are you the girl,‘ he said, turning his eyes away as he spoke, ‗are you the

girl who has a room in the furthest corner of the inner court of the

farmhouse?‘

‗Yes, my lord, I am,‘ answered she.

‗Hold out your hand then,‘ continued the prince, feeling that he must keep

his word, whatever the cost, and, to the astonishment of every one present,

a little hand, white and delicate, came from beneath the black and dirty

skin. The ring slipped on with the utmost ease, and, as it did so, the skin

fell to the ground, disclosing a figure of such beauty that the prince, weak

as he was, fell on his knees before her, while the king and queen joined

their prayers to his. Indeed, their welcome was so warm, and their caresses

so bewildering, that the princess hardly knew how to find words to reply,

when the ceiling of the hall opened, and the fairy godmother appeared,

seated in a car made entirely of white lilac. In a few words, she explained

the history of the princess, and how she came to be there, and, without

losing a moment, preparations of the most magnificent kind were made for

the wedding.

The kings of every country in the earth were invited, including, of course,

the princess‘s adopted father (who by this time had married a widow), and

not one refused.

But what a strange assembly it was! Each monarch traveled in the way he

thought most impressive; and some came borne in litters, others had

carriages of every shape and kind, while the rest were mounted on

elephants, tigers, and even upon eagles. So, splendid a wedding had never

been seen before; and when it was over the king announced that it was to

be followed by a coronation, for he and the queen were tired of reigning,

and the young couple must take their place. The rejoicings lasted for three

whole months, then the new sovereigns settled down to govern their

57



kingdom, and made themselves so much beloved by their subjects, that

when they died, a hundred years later, each man mourned them as his own

father and mother.





Chapter 9 Hansel and Gretel Story


ONCE upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor

woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel and

the girl Gretel. He had always little enough to live on, and once, when

times were bad, they had to get by with one piece of bread and butter each.

One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he

sighed and said to his wife: ―What‘s to become of us? how are we to feed

our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?‖ ―I‘ll tell

you what, husband,‖ answered the woman; ―early to-morrow morning

we‘ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall

light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we‘ll go on to

our work and leave them alone. They won‘t be able to find their way home,

and we shall be rid of them.‖ ―No, wife,‖ said her husband, ―that I won‘t

do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood?

The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.‖ ―Oh! you fool,‖

said she, ―then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go

and saw the boards for our coffins‖; and they argued and argued, until he

agreed that they must get rid of Hansel and Gretel. ―But I can‘t help feeling

sorry for the poor children,‖ added the husband.

The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard

what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitterly and

spoke to Hansel: ―Now it‘s all up with us.‖ ―No, no, Gretel,‖ said Hansel,

―don‘t fret yourself; I‘ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear.‖ And when

the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened

the back door and stole out. The moon was shining clearly, and the white

pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver. Hansel

58



bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in.

Then he went back and said to Gretel: ―Be comforted, my dear little sister,

and go to sleep: God will not desert us‖; and he lay down in bed again.

At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the

two children: ―Get up, you lie-abed, we‘re all going to the forest to fetch

wood.‖ She gave them each a bit of bread and said: ―There‘s something for

your luncheon, but don‘t you eat it up before, for it‘s all you‘ll get.‖ Gretel

took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.

Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. After they had

walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this

maneuver he repeated and again. His father observed him, and said:

―Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain

behind? Take care, and don‘t lose your footing.‖ ―Oh! father,‖ said Hansel,

―I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving

me a farewell.‖ The woman exclaimed: ―What a donkey you are! that isn‘t

your kitten, that‘s the morning sun shining on the chimney.‖ But Hansel

had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white

pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.

When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: ―Now,

children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I‘ll light a fire that you may not

feel cold.‖ Hansel and Gretel heaped up brushwood till they had made a

pile nearly the size of a small hill. The brushwood was set fire to, and when

the flames leaped high the woman said: ―Now lie down at the fire,

children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut down

wood; when we‘ve finished, we‘ll come back and fetch you.‖ Hansel and

Gretel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread.

They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite

near. But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree,

and that was blown about by the wind. And when they had sat for a long

time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When they

awoke at last it was pitch dark. Gretel began to cry, and said: ―How are we

ever to get out of the wood?‖ But Hansel comforted her. ―Wait a bit,‖ he

said, ―till the moon is up, and then we‘ll find our way sure enough.‖ And

59



when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed

the pebbles, which shone like new three penny bits, and showed them the

path. They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their

father‘s house again. They knocked at the door, and when the woman

opened it she exclaimed: ―You naughty children, what a time you‘ve slept

in the wood! we thought you were never going to come back.‖ But the

father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his

children behind by themselves.

Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the

children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night:

―Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house,

and when that‘s done it‘s all up with us. The children must be got rid of;

we‘ll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they won‘t be able

to find their way out again. There is no other way of saving ourselves.‖ The

man‘s heart smote him heavily, and he thought: ―Surely it would be better

to share the last bite with one‘s children!‖ But his wife wouldn‘t listen to

his arguments, and did nothing but scold and reproach him. If a man

yields once he‘s done for, and so, because he had given in the first time, he

was forced to do so the second.

But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation. When the

old people were, asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up

pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the

door, and Hansel couldn‘t get out. But he consoled his little sister, and said:

―Don‘t cry, Gretel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.‖

At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up. They

received their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before. On

the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few

minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground. ―Hansel, what

are you stopping and looking about you for?‖ said the father. ―I‘m looking

back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,‖

answered Hansel. ―Fool!‖ said the wife; ―that isn‘t your pigeon, it‘s the

morning sun glittering on the chimney.‖ But Hansel gradually threw all his

crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest

60



farther than they had ever been in their lives before. Then a big fire was lit

again, and the mother said: ―Just sit down there, children, and if you‘re

tired you can sleep a bit; we‘re going into the forest to cut down wood, and

in the evening when we‘re finished we‘ll come back to fetch you.‖ At

midday Gretel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had strewn his all

along their path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but

nobody came to the poor children. They didn‘t awake till it was pitch dark,

and Hansel comforted his sister, saying: ―Only wait, Gretel, till the moon

rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they

will show us the way back to the house.‖ When the moon appeared, they

got up, but they found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about

the woods and fields had picked them all up. ―Never mind,‖ said Hansel to

Greet- tell; ―you‘ll see we‘ll find a way out‖; but all the same they did not.

They wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till

evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood. They were very

hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found

growing on the ground. And at last they were so tired that their legs

refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell

fast asleep.

On the third morning after they had left their father‘s house they set about

their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the wood, and

now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish. At

midday, they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch,

which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it. And when

its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them.

They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched;

and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of

bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent

sugar. ―Now we‘ll set to,‖ said Hansel, ―and have a regular blow-out. I‘ll

eat a bit of the roof, and you, Gretel, can eat some of the window, which

you‘ll find a sweet morsel.‖ Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a

little bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Gretel went to the casement

and began to nibble at it. Thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room

inside:

61



―Nibble, nibble, little mouse, who‘s nibbling my house?‖

The children answered:

―Tis Heaven‘s own child, The tempest wild,‖

and went on eating, without putting themselves about. Hansel, who

thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Gretel

pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy

it. Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff

hobbled out. Hansel and Gretel were so terrified that they let what they

had in their hands fall. But the old woman shook her head and said: ―Oh,

ho! you dear children, who led you here? Just come in and stay with me, no

ill shall befall you.‖ She took them both by the hand and let them into the

house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them–milk and sugared

pancakes, with apples and nuts. After they had finished, two beautiful little

white beds were prepared for them, and when Hansel and Gretel lay down

in them they felt as if they had got into heaven.

The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an

old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread

house to lure them in. When anyone came into her power she killed,

cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the occasion. Now

witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but, like beasts, they have a keen

sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by. When Hansel and

Gretel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: ―I‘ve

got them now; they shan‘t escape me.‖ Early in the morning, before the

children were awake, she rose, and when she saw them both sleeping so

peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: ―That‘ll

be a dainty bite.‖ Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried

him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as

much as he liked, it did him no good. Then she went to Gretel, shook her

till she awoke, and cried: ―Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook

something for your brother. When he‘s fat I‘ll eat him up.‖ Gretel began to

cry bitterly, but it was of no use; she had to do what the wicked witch bade

her.

62



So, the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but

crab-shells. Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and

cried: ―Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting fat.‖

But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes

were dim, couldn‘t see it, and thinking always it was Hansel‘s finger,

wondered why he fattened so slowly. When four weeks had passed and

Hansel remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer.

―Hi, Gretel,‖ she called to the girl, Abe quick and get some water. Hansel

may be fat or thin, I‘m going to kill him to-morrow and cook him.‖ Oh!

how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears

rolled down her cheeks! ―Kind heaven help us now!‖ she cried; ―if only the

wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died

together.‖ ―Just hold your peace,‖ said the old hag; ―it won‘t help you.‖

Early in the morning Gretel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of

water, and light the fire. ―First, we‘ll bake,‖ said the old dame; ―I‘ve heated

the oven already and kneaded the dough.‖ She pushed Gretel out to the

oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. ―Creep in,‖ said the

witch, ―and see if it‘s properly heated, so that we can shove in the bread.‖

For when she had got Gretel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl

bake, that she might eat her up too. But Gretel perceived her intention, and

said: ―I don‘t know how I‘m to do it; how do I get in?‖ ―Your silly goose!‖

said the hag, ―the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself,‖ and

she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave

her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt.

Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Gretel fled, and the

wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.

Gretel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable- door, and cried:

―Hansel, we are free; the old witch is dead.‖ Then Hansel sprang like a bird

out of a cage when the door is opened. How they rejoiced, and fell on each

other‘s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one another! And as they had

no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hag‘s house, and here

they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious

stones. ―These are even better than pebbles,‖ said Hansel, and crammed his

63



pockets full of them; and Gretel said: ―I too will bring something home,‖

and she filled her apron full. ―But now,‖ said Hansel, ―let‘s go and get well

away from the witch‘s wood.‖ When they had wandered about for some

hours they came to a big lake. ―We can‘t get over,‖ said Hansel; ―I see no

bridge of any sort or kind.‖ ―Yes, and there‘s no ferry-boat either,‖

answered Gretel; ―but look, there swims a white duck; if I ask her she‘ll

help us over,‖ and she called out:

―Here are two children, mournful very, seeing neither bridge nor ferry;

Take us upon your white back, And row us over, quack, quack!‖

The duck swam toward them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his

little sister sit beside him. ―No,‖ answered Gretel, ―we should be too heavy

a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately.‖ The good bird did

this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for

a while, the wood became more and more familiar to them, and at length

they saw their father‘s house in the distance. Then they set off to run, and

bounding into the room fell on their father‘s neck. The man had not passed

a happy hour since he left them in the wood, but the woman had died.

Gretel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled

about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of

his pocket. Thus, all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever

afterward.





Chapter 10 King Thrush Beard Story


A King had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so

proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her. She sent

away one after the other, and ridiculed them as well.

Once the King made a great feast and invited thereto, from far and near, all

64



the young men likely to marry. They were all marshalled in a row per their

rank and standing; first came the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the

princes, the earls, the barons, and the gentry. Then the King‘s daughter was

led through the ranks, but to every one she had some objection to make;

one was too fat, ―The wine-cask,‖ she said. Another was too tall, ―Long and

thin has little in.‖ The third was too short, ―Short and thick is never quick.‖

The fourth was too pale, ―As pale as death.‖ The fifth too red, ―A fighting-

cock.‖ The sixth was not straight enough, ―A green log dried behind the

stove.‖

So, she had something to say against everyone, but she made herself

especially merry over a good king who stood quite high up in the row, and

whose chin had grown a little crooked. ―Well,‖ she cried and laughed, ―he

has a chin like a thrush‘s beak!‖ and from that time he got the name of King

Thrush beard.

But the old King, when he saw that his daughter did nothing but mock the

people, and despised all the suitors who were gathered there, was very

angry, and swore that she should have for her husband the very first

beggar that came to his doors.

A few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows,

trying to earn some small alms. When the King heard, him he said, ―Let

him come up.‖ So, the fiddler came in, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and

sang before the King and his daughter, and when he had ended he asked

for a trifling gift. The King said, ―Your song has pleased me so well that I

will give you my daughter there, to wife.‖

The King‘s daughter shuddered, but the King said, ―I have taken an oath to

give you to the very first beggar-man, and I will keep it.‖ All she could say

was in vain; the priest was brought, and she had to let herself be wedded to

the fiddler on the spot. When that was done, the King said, ―Now it is not

proper for you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may

just go away with your husband.‖

The beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to walk

away on foot with him. When they came to a large forest she asked, ―To

65



whom does that beautiful forest belong?‖ ―It belongs to King Thrush

beard; if you had taken him, it would have been yours.‖ ―Ah, unhappy girl

that I am, if I had but taken King Thrush beard!‖

Afterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, ―To whom does

this beautiful green meadow belong?‖ ―It belongs to King Thrush beard; if

you had taken him, it would have been yours.‖ ―Ah, unhappy girl that I

am, if I had but taken King Thrush beard!‖

Then they came to a large town, and she asked again, ―To whom does this

fine large town belong?‖ ―It belongs to King Thrush beard; if you had

taken him, it would have been yours.‖ ―Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had

but taken King Thrush beard!‖

―It does not please me,‖ said the fiddler, ―to hear you always wishing for

another husband; am I not good enough for you?‖ At last they came to a

very little hut, and she said, ―Oh goodness! what a small house; to whom

does this miserable, mean hovel belong?‖ The fiddler answered, ―That is

my house and yours, where we shall live together.‖

She had to stoop to go in at the low door. ―Where are the servants?‖ said

the King‘s daughter. ―What servants?‖ answered the beggar-man; ―you

must yourself do what you wish to have done. Just make a fire at once, and

set on water to cook my supper, I am quite tired.‖ But the King‘s daughter

knew nothing about lighting fires or cooking, and the beggar-man had to

lend a hand himself to get anything fairly done. When they had finished

their scanty meal, they went to bed; but he forced her to get up quite early

in the morning to look after the house.

For a few days, they lived in this way as well as might be, and came to the

end of all their provisions. Then the man said, ―Wife, we cannot go on any

longer eating and drinking here and earning nothing. You weave baskets.‖

He went out, cut some willows, and brought them home. Then she began

to weave, but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.

―I see that this will not do,‖ said the man; ―you had better spin, perhaps

you can do that better.‖ She sat down and tried to spin, but the hard thread

soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood ran down. ―See,‖ said the man,

66



―you are fit for no sort of work; I have made a bad bargain with you. Now I

will try to make a business with pots and earthenware; you must sit in the

market-place and sell the ware.‖ ―Alas,‖ thought she, ―if any of the people

from my father‘s kingdom come to the market and see me sitting there,

selling, how they will mock me?‖ But it was of no use, she had to yield

unless she chose to die of hunger.

For the first time, she succeeded well, for the people were glad to buy the

woman‘s wares because she was good-looking, and they paid her what she

asked; many even gave her the money and left the pots with her as well.

So, they lived on what she had earned if it lasted, then the husband bought

a lot of new crockery. With this she sat down at the corner of the market-

place, and set it out round about her ready for sale. But suddenly there

came a drunken hussar galloping along, and he rode right amongst the

pots so that they were all broken into a thousand bits. She began to weep,

and did now know what to do for fear. ―Alas! what will happen to me?‖

cried she; ―what will my husband say to this?‖

She ran home and told him of the misfortune. ―Who would seat herself at a

corner of the market-place with crockery?‖ said the man; ―leave off crying,

I see very well that you cannot do any ordinary work, so I have been to our

King‘s palace and have asked whether they cannot find a place for a

kitchen-maid, and they have promised me to take you; in that way, you

will get your food for nothing.‖

The King‘s daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at the cook‘s

beck and call, and do the dirtiest work. In both her pockets she fastened a

little jar, in which she took home her share of the leavings, and upon this

they lived.

It happened that the wedding of the King‘s eldest son was to be celebrated,

so the poor woman went up and placed herself by the door of the hall to

look on. When all the candles were lit, and people, each more beautiful

than the other, entered, and all was full of pomp and splendor, she thought

of her lot with a sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which

had humbled her and brought her to so great poverty.

67



The smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in and out

reached her, and now and then the servants threw her a few morsels of

them: these she put in her jars to take home.

All at once the King‘s son entered, clothed in velvet and silk, with gold

chains about his neck. And when he saw the beautiful woman standing by

the door he seized her by the hand, and would have danced with her; but

she refused and shrank with fear, for she saw that it was King Thrush

beard, her suitor whom she had driven away with scorn. Her struggles

were of no avail, he drew her into the hall; but the string by which her

pockets were hung broke, the pots fell, the soup ran out, and the scraps

were scattered all about. And when the people saw it, there arose general

laughter and derision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have

been a thousand fathoms below the ground. She sprang to the door and

would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught her and brought her

back; and when she looked at him it was King Thrush beard again. He said

to her kindly, ―Do not be afraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with

you in that wretched hovel are one. For love of you I disguised myself so;

and I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery. This was all

done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish you for the insolence with

which you mocked me.‖

Then she wept bitterly and said, ―I have done great wrong, and am not

worthy to be your wife.‖ But he said, ―Be comforted, the evil days are past;

now we will celebrate our wedding.‖ Then the maids-in-waiting came and

put on her the most splendid clothing, and her father and his whole court

came and wished her happiness in her marriage with King Thrush beard,

and the joy now began in earnest. I wish you and I had been there too.



Chapter 11 The Canary Prince Story



There was a king who had a daughter. Her mother was dead, and the

stepmother was jealous of the girl and always spoke badly of her to the

king. The maiden defended herself as best as she could, but the stepmother

68



was so contrary and insistent that the king, though he loved his daughter,

finally gave in. He told the queen to send the girl away, but to some place

where she would be comfortable, for he would never allow her to be

mistreated. ―Have no fear of that,‖ said the stepmother, who then had the

girl shut up in a castle in the heart of the forest. To keep her company, the

queen selected a group of ladies-in-waiting, ordering them never to let the

girl go out of the house or even to look out the windows. The girl was

given a beautiful room and all she wanted to eat and drink. The only thing

she couldn‘t do was go outdoors. The girl was lonely but the ladies,

enjoying so much leisure time and money, thought only of themselves and

paid no attention to her.

Every now and then the king would ask his wife, ―And how is our

daughter? What is she doing with herself these days?‖ To prove that she

did take an interest in the girl, the queen called on her. The minute she

stepped from her carriage, the ladies-in-waiting all rushed out and told her

not to worry, the girl was well and happy. She informed the king she had

never seen his daughter so content.

On the contrary, the princess was always alone in her room and she spent

her days wistfully at the window. She sat there leaning on the windowsill,

and had she not thought to put a pillow under them, she would have got

calluses on her elbows. The window looked out on the forest, and all day

long the princess saw nothing but treetops, clouds and, down below, the

hunters‘ trail. Over that trail one day came the son of a king in pursuit of a

wild boar. Nearing the castle known to have been unoccupied for no telling

how many years, he was amazed to see washing spread out on the

battlements, smoke rising from the chimneys, and open casements. As he

looked about him, he noticed a beautiful maiden at one of the upper

windows and smiled at her. The maiden saw the prince too, dressed in

yellow, with hunter‘s leggings and gun, and smiling at her, so she smiled

back at him. For a whole hour, they smiled, bowed, and curtsied, being too

far apart to communicate in any other way.

The next day, under the pretext of going hunting, the king‘s son returned,

dressed in yellow, and they stared at each other this time for two hours; in

69



addition to smiles, bows, and curtsies, they put a hand over their hearts

and waved handkerchiefs at great length. The third day the prince stopped

for three hours, and they blew each other kisses. The fourth day he was

there as usual, when from behind a tree a witch peeped and began to

guffaw: ―Ho, ho, ho, ho!‖

―Who are you? What‘s so funny?‖ snapped the prince.

―What‘s so funny? Two lovers silly enough to stay so far apart!‖

―Would you know how to get any closer to her, ninny?‖ asked the prince.

―I like you both,‖ said the witch, ―and I‘ll help you.‖

She knocked at the door and handed the ladies-in-waiting a big old book

with yellow, smudgy pages, saying it was a gift to the princess so the

young lady could pass the time reading. The ladies took it to the girl, who

opened it at once and read: ―This is a magic book. Turn the pages forward,

and the man becomes a bird; turn them back, and the bird becomes a man

once more.‖

The girl ran to the window, placed the book on the sill, and turned the

pages in great haste while watching the youth in yellow standing in the

path. Moving his arms, he was soon flapping wings and changed into a

canary, dressed in yellow as he was. Up he soared above the treetops and

headed straight for the window, coming to rest on the cushioned sill. The

princess couldn‘t resist picking up the beautiful canary and kissing him;

then remembering he was a young man, she blushed. But on second

thought she wasn‘t ashamed at all and made haste to turn him back into a

youth. She picked up the book and thumbed backward through it; the

canary ruffled his yellow feathers, flapped his wings, then moved arms

and was once more the youth dressed in yellow with the hunter‘s leggings,

who knelt before her, declaring, ―I love you!‖

By the time, they finished confessing all their love for one another, it was

evening. Slowly, the princess leafed through the book. Considering her

eyes the youth turned back into a canary, perched on the windowsill, then

on the eaves, then trusting to the wind, flew down in wide arcs, lighting on

70



the lower limb of a tree. At that, she turned the pages back in the book and

the canary was a prince once more who jumped down, whistled for his

dogs, threw a kiss toward the window, and continued along the trail out of

sight.

So, every day the pages were turned forward to bring the prince flying up

to the window at the top of the tower, then turned backward to restore his

human form, then forward again to enable him to fly away, and finally

backward for him to get home. Never in their whole life had the two-

young people known such happiness.

One day the queen called on her stepdaughter. She walked about the room,

saying, ―You‘re all right, aren‘t you? I see you‘re a trifle slimmer, but that‘s

certainly no cause for concern, is it? It‘s true, isn‘t it, you‘ve never felt

better?‖ As she talked, she checked to see that everything was in place. She

opened the window and peered out. Here came the prince in yellow along

the trail with his dogs. ―If this silly girl thinks she is going to flirt at the

window,‖ said the stepmother to herself, ―she has another thought coming

to her.‖ She sent the girl for a glass of water and some sugar, then

hurriedly removed five or six hairpins from her own hair and concealed

them in the pillow with the sharp points sticking straight up. ―That will

teach her to lean on the windowsill!‖ The girl returned with the water and

sugar, but the queen said, ―Oh, I‘m no longer thirsty; you drink it, my dear!

I must be getting back to your father. You don‘t need anything, do you?

Well, goodbye.‖ And she was off.

As soon as the queen‘s carriage was out of sight, the girl hurriedly flipped

over the pages of the book, the prince turned into a canary, flew to the

window, and struck the pillow like an arrow. He instantly let out a shrill

cry of pain. The yellow feathers were stained with blood; the canary had

driven the pins into his breast. He rose with a convulsive flapping, trusted

himself to the wind, descended in irregular arcs, and lit on the ground with

outstretched wings. The frightened princess, not yet fully aware of what

had happened, quickly turned the pages back in the hope there would be

no wounds when he regained his human form. Alas, the prince reappeared

71



dripping blood from the deep stabs that had rent the yellow garment on his

chest, and lay back surrounded by his dogs.

At the howling of the dogs, the other hunters came to his aid and carried

him off on a stretcher of branches, but he didn‘t so much as glance up at

the window of his beloved, who was still overwhelmed with grief and

fright.

Back at his palace, the prince showed no promise of recovery, nor did the

doctors know what to do for him. The wounds refused to heal over, and

constantly hurt. His father the king posted proclamations on every street

corner promising a fortune to anyone who could cure him, but not a soul

turned up to try.

The princess meanwhile was consumed with longing for her lover. She cut

her sheets into thin strips which she tied one to the other in a long, long

rope. Then one night she let herself down from the high tower and set out

on the hunters‘ trail. But because of the thick darkness and the howls of the

wolves, she decided to wait for daylight. Finding an old oak with a hollow

trunk, she nestled inside and, in her exhaustion, fell asleep at once. She

woke up while it was still pitch-dark, under the impression she had heard

a whistle. Listening closely, she heard another whistle, then a third and a

fourth, after which she saw four candle flames advancing. They were four

witches coming from the four corners of the earth to their appointed

meeting under that tree. Through a crack in the trunk the princess, unseen

by them, spied on the four crones carrying candles and sneering a welcome

to one another: ―Ah, ah, ah!‖

They lit a bonfire under the tree and sat down to warm themselves and

roast a couple of bats for dinner. When they had eaten their fill, they began

asking one another what they had seen of interest out in the world.

―I saw the sultan of Turkey, who bought himself twenty new wives.‖

―I saw the emperor of China, who has let his pigtail grow three yards

long.‖

―I saw the king of the cannibals, who ate his chamberlain by mistake.‖

72



―I saw the king of this region, who has the sick son nobody can cure, since I

alone know the remedy.‖

―And what is it?‖ asked the other witches.

―In the floor of his room is a loose tile. All one need to do is lift the tile, and

there underneath is a phial containing an ointment that would heal every

one of his wounds.‖

It was all the princess inside the tree could do not to scream for joy. By this

time the witches had told one another all they had to say, so each went her

own way. The princess jumped from the tree and set out in the dawn for

the city. At the first secondhand dealer‘s she came to, she bought an old

doctor‘s gown and a pair of spectacles, and knocked at the royal palace.

Seeing the little doctor with such scant paraphernalia, the servants weren‘t

going to let him in, but the king said, ―What harm could he do my son who

can‘t be any worse off than he is now? Let him see what he can do.‖ The

sham doctor asked to be left alone with the sick man, and the request was

granted.

Finding her lover groaning and unconscious in his sickbed, the princess felt

like weeping and smothering him with kisses. But she restrained herself

because of the urgency of carrying out the witch‘s directions. She paced up

and down the room until she stepped on a loose tile, which she raised and

discovered a phial of ointment. With it she rubbed the prince‘s wounds,

and no sooner had she touched each one with ointment than the wound

disappeared completely. Overjoyed she called the king, who came in and

saw his son sleeping peacefully, with the color back in his cheeks, and no

trace of any of the wounds.

―Ask for whatever you like, doctor,‖ said the king. ―All the wealth in the

kingdom is yours.‖

―I wish no money,‖ replied the doctor. ―Just give me the prince‘s shield

bearing the family coat-of-arms, his standard, and his yellow vest that was

rent and bloodied.‖ Upon receiving the three items, she took her leave.

73



Three days later, the king‘s son was again out hunting. He passed the castle

in the heart of the forest, but didn‘t deign to look up at the princess‘s

window. She immediately picked up the book, leafed through it, and the

prince had no choice but change into a canary. He flew into the room, and

the princess turned him back into a man. ―Let me go,‖ he said. ―Isn‘t it

enough to have pierced me with those pins of yours and caused me so

much agony?‖ The prince, in truth, no longer loved the girl, blaming her

for his misfortune.

On the verge of fainting, she exclaimed, ―But I saved your life! I am the one

who cured you!‖

―That‘s not so,‖ said the prince. ―My life was saved by a foreign doctor

who asked for no recompense except my coat-of-arms, my standard, and

my bloodied vest!‖

―Here are your coat-of-arms, your standard, and your vest! The doctor was

none other than myself! The pins were the cruel doing of my stepmother!‖

The prince gazed into her eyes, dumbfounded. Never had she looked so

beautiful. He fell at her feet asking her forgiveness and declaring his deep

gratitude and love.

That very evening he informed his father he was going to marry the

maiden in the castle in the forest.

―You may marry only the daughter of a king or an emperor,‖ replied his

father.

―I shall marry the woman who saved my life.‖

So, they prepared for the wedding, inviting all the kings and queens in the

vicinity. Also present was the princess‘s royal father, who had been

informed of nothing. When the bride came out, he looked at her and

exclaimed, ―My daughter!‖

―What!‖ said the royal host. ―My son‘s bride is your daughter? Why did

she not tell us?‖

74



―Because,‖ explained the bride, ―I no longer consider myself the daughter

of a man who let my stepmother imprison me.‖ And she pointed at the

queen.

Learning of all his daughter‘s misfortune, the father was filled with pity for

the girl and with loathing for his wicked wife. Nor did he wait until he was

back home to have the woman seized. Thus, the marriage was celebrated to

the satisfaction and joy of all, except for that wretch.





Chapter 12 Rapunzel Story


There once lived a man and a woman who always wished for a child, but

could not have one. These people had a little window at the back of their

house from which a splendid garden could be seen. The garden was full of

the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a

high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to a witch,

who had great power and was feared by all the world.

One day the woman was standing by the window and looking down into

the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the tastiest

Rapunzel. It looked so fresh and green that she longed for it and had the

greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day. The woman

knew that she could not get any of it and grew more pale and miserable

each day.

Her husband was worried about her and asked ―What is wrong my dear?‖

―Ah,‖ she replied, ―if I can‘t eat some of the Rapunzel from the garden

behind our house I think I shall die.‖

The man, who loved her, thought, ―Sooner than let my lovely wife die, I

will bring her some of the Rapunzel myself, no matter what the cost.‖

In the twilight of the evening, he climbed over the wall into the garden of

the witch, hastily grabbed a handful of Rapunzel and took it to his wife.

She at once made herself a salad and ate it happily. She, however, liked it

so much — so very much, that the next day she longed for it three times as

much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more

descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he set out

75



again; but when he had climbed over the wall he was terribly afraid, for he

saw the witch standing before him.

―How dare you,‖ she said with angry look, ―sneak into my garden and

steal my Rapunzel like a thief? You shall suffer for this!‖

―Ah,‖ the frightened husband answered, ―please have mercy, I had to have

the Rapunzel. My wife saw it from the window and felt such a longing for

it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.‖

Then the witch allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, ―If this is

true, I will allow you to take as much as you like, only I make one

condition. You must give me the baby daughter your wife will bring into

the world; she shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.‖

The man in his fear consented and when the baby was born the witch

appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel and took the baby

away with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she

was twelve years old, the witch shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest.

The tower had no stairs or doors, but only a little window at the very top.

When the witch wanted to go in, she stood beneath the window and cried,

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair.”

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she

heard the voice of the witch she wound her braids round one of the hooks

of the window, and then the hair fell down the side of the tower and the

witch climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the Prince rode through the forest

and went by the tower. He heard a song which was so lovely that he stood

still and listened. This was Rapunzel who in her loneliness passed her time

singing. The Prince wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of

the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so

deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and

listened to it.

76



Once when he was standing behind a tree listening to Rapunzel‘s song, he

saw the witch come and heard how she cried,

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair.”

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the witch climbed up to

her.

―If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune,‖

thought the Prince and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went

to the tower and cried,

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair.”

Immediately the hair fell and the Prince climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes had

never seen, came to her; but the Prince began to talk to her quite like a

friend and told her that his heart had been so stirred by her singing that it

had let him have no rest. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked

her if she would take him for her husband — and she saw that he was kind

and handsome, she said yes, and laid her hand in his.

She said, ―I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get

down. Bring a bit of silk with you every time you come and I will weave a

ladder with it. When that is ready I will climb down and we shall escape

together.‖ They agreed that until that time he should come to her every

evening, for the old woman came by day.

The witch knew nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said in her distraction,

―Oh my, you are so much heavier when you climb than the young Prince.‖

―Ah! you wicked child,‖ cried the witch ―What do I hear thee say! I

thought I had separated you from all the world but you have deceived

me.‖

In her anger, she clutched Rapunzel‘s beautiful hair, seized a pair of

scissors — and snip, snap — cut it all off. Rapunzel‘s lovely braids lay on

77



the ground but the witch was not through. She was so angry that she took

poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.

The witch rushed back to the tower and fastened the braids of hair which

she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the Prince came and

cried,

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair,”

she let the hair down. The Prince climbed to the window, but he did not

find his dearest Rapunzel above, but the witch, who gazed at him with a

wicked and venomous look.

―Aha!‖ she cried mockingly, ―You‘ve come for Rapunzel but the beautiful

bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it and will scratch out

your eyes as well. Rapunzel is banished and you will never see her again!‖

The Prince was beside himself and in his despair, he fell from the tower.

He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.

Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and

berries and did nothing but weep over the loss of his dearest Rapunzel.

In this way, the Prince roamed in misery for some months and at length

came to the desert where the witch had banished Rapunzel. He heard a

voice singing and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it.

When he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell into his arms and wept.

Two of her tears fell on his eyes and the Prince could see again. He led her

to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long

time afterwards, happy and contented.



Chapter 13 Maria and the Seven Robbers Story

Once upon a time there was a man whose wife died, and he had only a

little daughter, whose name was Maria.

Maria went to school to a woman who taught her sewing and knitting. In

78



the evening when she left for home the woman would always say to her,

―Give your father my kindest greetings.‖

Because of these friendly greetings, the man thought, ―She would be a wife

for me,‖ and he married the woman.

After they were married, the woman became very unfriendly toward poor

Maria, and with time she could not stand her at all.

Then she said to her husband, ―The girl eats too much of our bread. We

must get rid of her.‖

But the man said, ―I cannot kill my child!‖

Then the woman said, ―Tomorrow take her with you out into the country

and leave her there alone, so that she will not be able to find her way back

home.‖

The next day the man called his daughter and said to her, ―We are going

out into the country. We will take something to eat with us.‖

Then he got a large loaf of bread, and they set forth. However, Maria was

clever, and she filled her pockets with bran. As she walked along behind

her father, from time to time she threw down a little pile of bran onto the

pathway. After walking for many hours, they came to the top of a steep

cliff. Her father dropped the loaf of bread over the cliff, then cried out, ―Oh,

Maria, our bread fell down there!‖

―Father,‖ said Maria, ―I will climb down and get it.‖

So, she climbed down the cliff and got the bread, but by the time she had

climbed back up to the top, her father had gone away, and Maria was all

alone.

She started to cry, for she was very far from home, and in a strange place.

But then she thought about the bran and took courage. Following the bran,

she finally arrived home again, late that night.

―Oh, father,‖ she said, ―why did you leave me alone?‖

The man comforted her and talked to her until he had reassured her.

79



The stepmother was very angry that Maria had found the way back, and

sometime later she again told her husband that he should take Maria out

into the country and abandon her in the woods.

The next morning the man called his daughter once again, and they set on

their journey. The father again carried a loaf of bread, but Maria forgot to

take the bran with her. In the woods, they came to an even steeper and

higher cliff. The father again dropped the bread over the edge, and Maria

had to climb down to get it. When she arrived back at the top, her father

had gone away, and she was alone. She began to cry bitterly, and she ran

one way and the other for a long time, only to find herself even deeper in

the dark woods.

Evening came, and suddenly she saw a light. She walked toward it and

came to a little house. Inside she found a set table and seven beds, but no

people were there.

The house belonged to seven robbers.

Maria hid behind a dough trough, and soon the seven robbers returned

home. They ate and drank, and then went to bed. The next morning, they

left, but the youngest brother remained at home to cook the food and clean

the house. After they had left, the youngest brother went out to buy food.

Then Maria came out from behind the dough trough, swept and cleaned

the house, and then put the kettle on the fire to cook the beans. Then once

again she hid behind the dough trough.

When the youngest brother returned home he was amazed to see

everything so clean, and when his brothers came back, he told them what

had happened. They were all astonished and could not imagine how it had

happened. The next day the second brother remained at home alone. He

pretended that he too was going away, but he returned at once and saw

Maria, who had come out once again to clean up the house.

Maria was frightened when she saw the robber. ―Oh,‖ she begged,‖ for

heaven‘s sake, do not kill me!‖

―Who are you?‖ asked the robber.

80



Then she told him about her wicked stepmother, and how her father had

abandoned her in the woods, and how for two days she had been hiding

behind the dough trough.

―You don‘t have to be afraid of us,‖ said the robber. ―Stay here with us and

be our sister, and cook, sew, and wash for us.‖

When the other brothers returned home, they were satisfied with this, so

Maria stayed with the seven robbers, did their housekeeping, and was

always quiet and diligent.

One day as she was sitting by the window sewing, a poor old woman came

by and asked for alms.

―Oh,‖ said Maria, ―I don‘t have much, for I myself am a poor, unhappy

girl, but I will give you what I have.‖

―Why are you so unhappy?‖ asked the beggar woman.

Then Maria told her how she had left home and had come here. The poor

woman went forth and told the wicked stepmother that Maria was still

alive. When the stepmother heard this, she was very angry, and she gave

the beggar woman a ring that she was to take to poor Maria. The ring was a

magic ring.

Eight days later the poor woman came again to Maria to beg for alms, and

when Maria gave her something, she said, ―Look, my child, I have here a

beautiful ring. Because you have been so good to me, I want to give it to

you.‖

Suspecting nothing, Maria took the ring, but when she put it on her finger

she fell as if dead.

When the robbers returned home and found Maria on the floor, they were

very sad, and they cried bitterly for her. Then they made a beautiful coffin

and laid Maria inside it, after having adorned her with the most beautiful

jewelry. They also put a large amount of gold in the coffin, which they then

set on an oxcart. They drove the oxcart into the city. When they came to the

king‘s castle they saw that the stall door was wide open. They drove the

81



oxen inside, to bring the cart into the stall. This caused the horses to

become very uneasy, and they began rearing up and making noise.

Hearing the noise, the king sent someone down to ask the stall-master

what had happened. The stall-master answered that a cart had been driven

into the stall. No one was with the cart, but on it there was a beautiful

coffin.

The king ordered that the coffin be brought to his room, and there he had it

opened. When he saw the beautiful dead girl inside, he began to cry

bitterly, and he could not leave her. He had four large wax candles brought

and had them placed at the four corners of the coffin and lit. Then he sent

everyone out of the room, barred the door, fell onto his knees before the

coffin, and wept hot tears.

When it was time to eat, his mother sent for him, asking him to come. He

did not answer at once, but instead wept more fervently. Then the old

queen herself came and knocked on the door and asked him to open it, but

he did not answer. She looked through the keyhole, and when she saw that

her son was kneeling next to a girl in a coffin, she had the door broken

down.

However, when she saw the beautiful girl, she herself was very moved,

and she leaned over Maria and took her hand. Seeing the beautiful ring,

she thought that it would be a shame to let it be buried along with the

corpse, so she pulled it off. Then all at once the dead Maria came to life

again.

The young king said joyfully to his mother, ―This girl shall be my wife!‖

The old queen answered, ―Yes, so shall it be!‖ and she embraced Maria.

Thus, Maria became the king‘s wife, and the queen. They lived joyfully and

in splendor until they died.





Chapter 14 The Goose Girl Story


The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their only

child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother

82



loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good fairy too,

who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her.

When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way

off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off

on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother, packed up a

great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses,

and in short everything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a

waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom‘s hands;

and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess‘s horse was the

fairy‘s gift, and it was called Fabada, and could speak.

When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-

chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to

the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may

be of use to you on the road.‘ Then they all took a sorrowful leave of the

princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom, got upon her horse,

and set off on her journey to her bridegroom‘s kingdom.

One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel

very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some

water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.‘ ‘Nay,‘

said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by the

water and drink; I shall not be your waiting- maid any longer.‘ Then she

was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and drank;

for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and she

wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?‘ And the lock answered her,

and said:

‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.‘

But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her

maid‘s ill behavior, but got upon her horse again.

Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the

sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last,

when they came to a river, she forgot her maid‘s rude speech, and said,

83



‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.‘ But

the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: ‘Drink

if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.‘ Then the princess was so

thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the

running stream, and cried and said, ‘What will become of me?‘ And the

lock of hair answered her again:

‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.‘

And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and

floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not

see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and

she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost

the hair. So, when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon

Fabada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Fabada, and you may have

my horse instead‘; so, she was forced to give up her horse, and soon

afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid‘s shabby ones.

At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant

threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened.

But Fabada saw it all, and marked it well.

Then the waiting-maid got upon Fabada, and the real bride rode upon the

other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal

court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet

them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who

was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the

true princess was told to stay in the court below.

Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so, he

amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was

going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and

too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask

the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing

in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her company on

the road,‘ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be

84



idle.‘ The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do;

but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and

help him.‘ Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in

watching the king‘s geese, was Curd ken.

But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one piece

of kindness.‘ ‘That I will,‘ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of your

slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very

unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road‘; but the truth was, she was very

much afraid lest Fabada should some day or other speak, and tell all she

had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Fabada was

killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the

man to nail up Fabada‘s head against a large dark gate of the city, through

which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might

still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she

wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.

Early the next morning, as she and Curd ken went out through the gate,

she said sorrowfully:

‘Fabada, Fabada, there thou hang!‘

and the head answered:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangs!

Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.‘

Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she

came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her

waving locks of hair, which were all pure silver; and when Curd ken saw it

glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out,

but she cried:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!

Let Curd ken‘s hat go!

Blow, breezes, blow!

Let him after it go!

85



O‘er hills, dales, and rocks,

Away be it whirl‘s

Till the silvery locks

Are all combed and curled!

Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curd ken‘s hat; and

away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till,

by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and

had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not

speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the

evening, and then drove them homewards.

The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl

looked up at Fabada‘s head, and cried:

‘Fabada, Fabada, there thou hang!‘

and the head answered:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangs!

Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,

Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.‘

Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and

began to comb out her hair as before; and Curd ken ran up to her, and

wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!

Let Curd ken‘s hat go!

Blow, breezes, blow!

Let him after it go!

O‘er hills, dales, and rocks,

Away be it whirl‘s

Till the silvery locks

Are all combed and curled!

Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,

over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he came

86



back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So, they watched

the geese till it grew dark.

In the evening, after they came home, Curd ken went to the old king, and

said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any

longer.‘ ‘Why?‘ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she does

nothing but tease me all day long.‘ Then the king made him tell him what

had happened. And Curd ken said, ‘When we go in the morning through

the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a

horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:

‘Fabada, Fabada, there thou hang!‘

and the head answers:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangs!

Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,

Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.‘

And Curd ken went on telling the king what had happened upon the

meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he

was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But

the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning

came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to

Fabada, and how Fabada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid

himself in a bush by the meadow‘s side; and he soon saw with his own

eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let

down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!

Let Curd ken‘s hat go!

Blow, breezes, blow!

Let him after it go!

O‘er hills, dales, and rocks,

Away be it whirl‘s

Till the silvery locks

Are all combed and curled!

87



And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curd ken‘s hat, and away

went Curd ken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her

hair. All this the old king saw: so, he went home without being seen; and

when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside, and

asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That I must

not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.‘

But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told him

all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky

for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered royal

clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so

beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false

bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood

by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how

meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false

bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The

bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true

one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite

dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl,

now that she had her brilliant dress on.

When they had eaten, and drank, and were very merry, the old king said

he would tell them a tale. So, he began, and told all the story of the

princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true

waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would

behave thus. ‘Nothing better,‘ said this false bride, ‘than that she should be

thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses

should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was

dead.‘ ‘Thou art she!‘ said the old king; ‘and as thou have judged thyself, so

shall it be done to thee.‘ And the young king was then married to his true

wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their

lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Fabada

to life again.

Chapter 15 Snow white and Rose red Story





A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in

which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red. She

had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called

Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best

children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white

was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red loved to run about

the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but

Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household,

or read aloud to her when there was no work to do. The two children loved

each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand

whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said, ―We will

never desert each other,‖ Rose-red answered: ―No, not if we live‖; and the

mother added: ―Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.‖ They

often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to

hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding

manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer

grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds

remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.

No evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook

them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their

mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them.

Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by

the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe

sitting close to their resting-place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly,

but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. And when they looked

round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a

precipice, over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a

few steps further in the darkness. And when they told their mother of their

89



adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that

guards good children.

Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother‘s cottage so beautifully clean

and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose-red looked

after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a

bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose. In winter, Snow-

white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so

beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the evening when the

snowflakes fell their mother said: ―Snow-white, go and close the shutters,‖

and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and

read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span.

Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a

little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.

One evening as they sat thus cozily together someone knocked at the door

as though he desired admittance. The mother said: ―Rose-red, open the

door quickly; it must be some traveler seeking shelter.‖ Rose-red hastened

to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the

darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his

thick black head through the door. Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang

back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and

Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother‘s bed. But the bear began to

speak, and said: ―Don‘t be afraid: I won‘t hurt you. I am half frozen, and

only wish to warm myself a little.‖ ―My poor bear,‖ said the mother, ―lie

down by the fire, only take care you don‘t burn your fur.‖ Then she called

out: ―Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm;

he is a good, honest creature.‖ So, they both came out of their hiding-

places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot

their fear. The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his

fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry. Then the

beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and

comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led

their helpless guest a fearful life. They tugged his fur with their hands, put

their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a

90



hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed. The

bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature, only

when they went too far he cried: ―Oh! children, spare my life!

―Snow-white and Rose-red,

Don‘t beat your lover dead.‖

When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the

mother said to the bear: ―You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven‘s name;

it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.‖ As soon as day dawned

the children led him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From

this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down

by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him;

and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their

black friend had made his appearance.

When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to

Snow-white: ―Now I must go away, and not return again the whole

summer.‖ ―Where are, you going to, dear bear?‖ asked Snow-white. ―I

must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs. In

winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain

underground, for they can‘t work their way through; but now, when the

sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up

above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into their

hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.‖ Snow-white

was quite sad over their friend‘s departure, and when she unbarred the

door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-

knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold

beneath it, but she couldn‘t be certain of it; and the bear ran hastily away,

and soon disappeared behind the trees.

A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect

fagots. They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on

the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something

jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn‘t distinguish. When

they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a

91



beard a yard long. The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree,

and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn‘t seem to

know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes, and

screamed out: ―What are you standing there for? Can‘t you come and help

me?‖ ―What were you doing, little man?‖ asked Rose-red. ―You stupid,

inquisitive goose!‖ replied the dwarf; ―I wanted to split the tree, to get little

chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires

for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food

we need. I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well,

but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the

tree closed so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard

out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can‘t get away; and you silly, smooth-

faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! what wretches you

are!‖

The children did all in their power, but they couldn‘t get the beard out; it

was wedged in far too firmly. ―I will run and fetch somebody,‖ said Rose-

red. ―Crazy blockheads!‖ snapped the dwarf; ―what‘s the good of calling

anyone else? You‘re already two too many for me. Does nothing better

occur to you than that?‖ ―Don‘t be so impatient,‖ said Snow-white, ―I‘ll see

you get help,‖ and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end

of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of

gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and

muttered aloud: ―Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my

splendid beard!‖ With these words, he swung the bag over his back, and

disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.

Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish.

As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an

enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to

jump in. They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf.

―Where are, you going to?‖ asked Rose-red; ―you‘re surely not going to

jump into the water?‖ ―I‘m not such a fool,‖ screamed the dwarf. ―Don‘t

you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?‖ The little man had been

sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately, the wind had entangled

92



his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the

feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper

fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to

every rush and blade of grass, but it didn‘t help him much; he had to

follow every movement of the fish, and was in great danger of being drawn

into the water. The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm,

and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain,

beard and line were in a hopeless muddle. Nothing remained but to

produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was

sacrificed.

When the dwarf perceived what, they were about he yelled to them: ―Do

you call that manners, you toad-stools! to disfigure a fellow‘s face? It

wasn‘t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now

needs cut off the best bit of it. I can‘t appear like this before my own

people. I wish you‘d been in Jericho first.‖ Then he fetched a sack of pearls

that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it

away and disappeared behind a stone.

It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to

buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a heath where

huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While trudging along

they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but

always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them.

Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They ran forward,

and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the

dwarf, and was about to carry him off. The tender-hearted children seized

hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let

go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he

screamed in his screeching voice: ―Couldn‘t you have treated me more

carefully? You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward

hussies that you are!‖ Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished

under the rocks into his cave. The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude,

and went on their way and did their business in town. On their way home,

as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out

93



his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would

pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering stones,

and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still

and gazed on them. ―What are you standing there gaping for?‖ screamed

the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage. He was about

to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a

black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright,

but he hadn‘t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already

close to him. Then he cried in terror: ―Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! I‘ll give you

all my treasure. Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare

my life! what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like

me? You won‘t feel me between your teeth. There, lay hold of these two

wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails;

eat them up, for heaven‘s sake.‖ But the bear, paying no attention to his

words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never

moved again.

The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: ―Snow-white and

Rose-red, don‘t be afraid; wait, and I‘ll come with you.‖ Then they

recognized his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to

them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all

dressed in gold. ―I am a king‘s son,‖ he said, ―and have been doomed by

that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the

woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free. Now he has got his

well-merited punishment.‖

Snow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the

great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them. The old

mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she carried

the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and

every year they bore the finest red and white roses.





Chapter 16 The Crystal Casket


94




There was once a widower who had a daughter. This daughter was

between ten and twelve years old. Her father sent her to school, and as she

always had one teacher who taught her many things. Now, the teacher,

seeing that the child had no mother, fell in love with the father, and kept

saying to the girl, ―Ask your father if he would like me for a wife.‖

This she said to her every day, and at last the girl said, ―Papa, the school-

mistress is always asking me if you will marry her.‖

The father said, ―Eh! my daughter, if I take another wife, you will have

great troubles.‖

But the girl persisted, and finally the father was persuaded to go one

evening to the school-mistress‘ house. When she saw, him she was well

pleased, and they settled the marriage in a few days. Poor child! How

bitterly she regrets having found a stepmother so ungrateful and cruel to

her! She sent her every day out on a long journey to water a pot of basil,

and it was so dangerous that if she fell she would go into a large river.

One day there came by a large eagle, and said to her, ―What are you doing

here?‖ She was weeping because she saw how great the danger was of

falling into the stream. The eagle said to her, ―Get on my back, and I will

carry you away, and you will be happier than with your new mamma.‖

After a long journey, they reached a great plain, where they found a

beautiful palace all of crystal; the eagle knocked at the door and said,

―Open, my ladies, open! for I have brought you a pretty girl.‖ When the

people in the palace opened the door, and saw that lovely girl, they were

amazed, and kissed and caressed her. Meanwhile the door was closed, and

they remained peaceful and contended.

Let us return to the eagle, who thought she was doing a spite to the

stepmother. One day the eagle flew away to the terrace where the

stepmother was watering the basil. ―Where is your daughter?‖ asked the

eagle.

―Eh!‖ she replied, ―perhaps she fell from this terrace and went into the

river; I have not heard from her in ten days.‖

95



The eagle answered, ―What a fool you are! I carried her away; seeing that

you treated her so harshly I carried her away to my fairies, and she is very

well.‖ Then the eagle flew away.

The stepmother, filled with rage and jealousy, called a witch from the city,

and said to her, ―You see my daughter is alive, and is in the house of some

fairies of an eagle which often comes upon my terrace; now you must do

me the favor to find some way to kill this stepdaughter of mine, for I am

afraid that someday or other she will return, and my husband, discovering

this matter, will certainly kill me.‖

The witch answered, ―Oh, you need not be afraid of that; leave it to me.‖

What did the witch do? She had made a little basketful of sweetmeats, in

which she put a charm; then she wrote a letter, pretending that it was her

father, who, having learned where she was, wished to make her this

present, and the letter pretended that her father was so glad to hear that

she was with the fairies.

Let us leave the witch who is arranging all this deception, and return to

Ermelinda (for so the young girl was named). The fairies had said to her,

―See, Ermelinda, we are going away, and shall be absent four days; now in

this time take good care not to open the door to anyone, for some treachery

is being prepared for you by your stepmother.‖

She promised to open the door to no one: ―Do not be anxious, I am well off,

and my stepmother has nothing to do with me.‖

But it was not so. The fairies went away, and the next day when Ermelinda

was alone, she heard a knocking at the door, and said to herself, ―Knock

away! I don‘t open to anyone.‖

But meanwhile the blows redoubled, and curiosity forced her to look out of

the window. What did she see? She saw one the servant girls of her own

home (for the witch had disguised herself as one of her father‘s servants).

―O my dear Ermelinda,‖ she said, ―your father is shedding tears of sorrow

for you, because he really believed you were dead, but the eagle which

carried you off came and told him the good news that you were here with

96



the fairies. Meanwhile your father, not knowing what civility to show you,

for he understands very well that you need nothing, has thought to send

you this little basket of sweetmeats.‖

Ermelinda had not yet opened the door; the servant begged her to come

down and take the basket and the letter, but she said, ―No, I wish nothing!‖

but finally, since women, and especially young girls, are fond of

sweetmeats, she descended and opened the door. When the witch had

given her the basket, she said, ―Eat this,‖ and broke off for her a piece of

the sweetmeats which she had poisoned. When Ermelinda took the first

mouthful the old woman disappeared. Ermelinda had scarcely time to

close the door, when she fell on the stairs.

When the fairies returned, they knocked at the door, but no one opened it

for them; then they perceived that there had been some treachery, and

began to weep. Then the chief of the fairies said, ―We must break open the

door,‖ and so they did, and saw Ermelinda dead on the stairs.

Her other friends who loved her so dearly begged the chief of the fairies to

bring her to life, but she would not, ―for,‖ she said, ―she has disobeyed

me.‖ But one and the other asked her until she consented; she opened

Ermelinda‘s mouth, took out a piece of the sweetmeat which she had not

yet swallowed, raised her up, and Ermelinda came to life again.

We can imagine what a pleasure it was for her friends; but the chief of the

fairies reproved her for her disobedience, and she promised not to do so

again.

Once more the fairies were obliged to depart. Their chief said, ―Remember,

Ermelinda: The first time I cured you, but the second I will have nothing to

do with you.‖

Ermelinda said they need not worry, that she would not open to anyone.

But it was not so; for the eagle, thinking to increase her stepmother‘s anger,

told her again that Ermelinda was alive. The stepmother denied it all to the

eagle, but she summoned anew the witch, and told her that her

stepdaughter was still alive, saying, ―Either you will really kill her, or I will

be avenged on you.‖

97



The old woman, finding herself caught, told her to buy a very handsome

dress, one of the handsomest she could find, and transformed herself into a

tailor belonging to the family, took the dress, departed, went to poor

Ermelinda, knocked at the door and said, ―Open, open, for I am your

tailors.‖

Ermelinda looked out of the window and saw her tailors; and was, in truth,

a little confused (indeed, anyone would have been so).

The tailors said, ―Come down, I must fit a dress on you.‖

She replied, ―No, no; for I have been deceived once.‖

―But I am not the old woman,‖ replied the tailors, ―you know me, for I

have always made your dresses.‖

Poor Ermelinda was persuaded, and descended the stairs; the tailors took

to flight while Ermelinda was yet buttoning up the dress, and disappeared.

Ermelinda closed the door, and was mounting the stairs; but it had not

permitted her to go up, for she fell down dead.

Let us return to the fairies, who came home and knocked at the door; but

what good did it do to knock! There was no longer anyone there. They

began to weep. The chief of the fairies said, ―I told you that she would

betray me again; but now I will have nothing more to do with her.‖

So, they broke open the door, and saw the poor girl with the beautiful dress

on; but she was dead. They all wept, because they really loved her. But

there was nothing to do; the chief struck her enchanted wand, and

commanded a beautiful rich casket all covered with diamonds and other

precious stones to appear; then the others made a beautiful garland of

flowers and gold, put it on the young girl, and then laid her in the casket,

which was so rich and beautiful that it was marvelous to behold. Then the

old fairy struck her wand as usual and commanded a handsome horse, the

like of which not even the king possessed. Then they took the casket, put it

on the horse‘s back, and led him into the public square of the city, and the

chief of the fairies said, ―Go, and do not stop until you find someone who

says to you, ‗Stop, for pity‘s sake, for I have lost my horse for you.‘‖

98



Now let us leave the afflicted fairies, and turn our attention to the horse,

which ran away at full speed. Who happened to pass at that moment? The

son of a king (the name of this king is not known); and saw this horse with

that wonder on its back. Then the king began to spur his horse, and rode

him so hard that he killed him, and had to leave him dead in the road; but

the king kept running after the other horse. The poor king could endure it

no longer; he saw himself lost, and exclaimed, ―Stop, for pity‘s sake, for I

have lost my horse for you!‖

Then the horse stopped (for those were the words). When the king saw that

beautiful girl dead in the casket, he thought no more about his own horse,

but took the other to the city. The king‘s mother knew that her son had

gone hunting; when she saw, him returning with this loaded horse, she did

not know what to think. The son had no father, wherefore he was all

powerful. He reached the palace, had the horse unloaded, and the casket

carried to his chamber; then he called his mother and said, ―Mother, I went

hunting, but I have found a wife.‖

―But what is it? A doll? A dead woman?‖

―Mother,‖ replied her son, ―don‘t trouble yourself about what it is, it is my

wife.‖

His mother began to laugh, and withdrew to her own room (what could

she do, poor mother?).

Now this poor king no longer went hunting, took no diversion, did not

even go to the table, but ate in his own room. By a fatality, it happened that

war was declared against him, and he was obliged to depart. He called his

mother, and said, ―Mother, I wish two careful chambermaids, whose

business it shall be to guard this casket; for if on my return, I find that

anything has happened to my casket, I shall have the chambermaids

killed.‖

His mother, who loved him, said, ―Go, my son, fear nothing, for I myself

will watch over your casket.‖

99



He wept several days at being obliged to abandon this treasure of his, but

there was no help for it, he had to go. After his departure, he did nothing

but commend his wife (so he called her) to his mother in his letters.

Let us return to the mother, who no longer thought about the matter, not

even to have the casket dusted; but all at once there came a letter which

informed her that the king had been victorious, and should return to his

palace in a few days. The mother called the chambermaids, and said to

them, ―Girls, we are ruined.‖

They replied, ―Why, Highness?‖

―Because my son will be back in a few days, and how have we taken care of

the doll?‖

They answered, ―True, true; now let us go and wash the doll‘s face.‖

They went to the king‘s room and saw that the doll‘s face and hands were

covered with dust and fly specks, so they took a sponge and washed her

face, but some drops of water fell on her dress and spotted it. The poor

chambermaids began to weep, and went to the queen for advice.

The queen said, ―Do you know what to do! Call a tailor, and have a dress

precisely like this bought, and take off this one before my son comes.‖

They did so, and the chambermaids went to the room and began to

unbutton the dress. The moment that they took off the first sleeve,

Ermelinda opened her eyes. The poor chambermaids sprang up in terror,

but one of the most courageous said, ―I am a woman, and so is this one; she

will not eat me.‖

To cut the matter short, she took off thee dress, and when it was removed

Ermelinda began to get out of the casket to walk about and see where she

was. The chambermaids fell on their knees before her and begged her to

tell them who she was. She, poor girl, told them the whole story. Then she

said, ―I wish to know where I am.‖

100



Then the chambermaids called the king‘s mother to explain it to her. The

mother did not fail to tell her everything, and she, poor girl, did nothing

but weep penitently, thinking of what the fairies had done for her.

The king was on the point of arriving, and his mother said to the doll,

―Come her; put on one of my best dresses.‖ In short, she arrayed her like a

queen. Then came her son. They shut the doll up in a small room, so that

she could not be seen. The king came with great joy, with trumpets

blowing, and banners flying for the victory. But he took no interest in all

this, and ran at once to his room to see the doll; the chambermaids fell on

their knees before him saying that the doll smelled so badly that they could

not stay in the palace, and were obliged to bury her.

The king would not listen to this excuse, but at once called two of the

palace servants to erect the gallows. His mother comforted him in vain:

―My son, it was a dead woman.‖

―No, no, I will not listen to any reasons; dead or alive, you should have left

it for me.‖

Finally, when his mother saw that he was in earnest about the gallows, she

rang a little bell, and there came forth no longer the doll, but a very

beautiful girl, whose like was never seen. The king was amazed, and said,

―What is this!‖

Then his mother, the chambermaids, and Ermelinda were obliged to tell

him all that had happened.

He said, ―Mother, since I adored her when dead, and called her my wife,

now I mean her to be my wife in truth.‖

―Yes, my son,‖ replied his mother, ―do so, for I am willing.‖

They arranged the wedding, and in a few days, were man and wife.





Chapter 17 The Twelve Oxen Story


101




There were twelve brothers who fell out with their father, and all twelve of

them left home. They built themselves a house in the woods and made

their living as carpenters. Meanwhile their parents had a baby girl, who

was a great comfort to them. The child grew up without ever meeting her

twelve brothers. She had only heard them mentioned, and she longed to

see them.

One day she went to bathe at a fountain, and the first thing she did was

remove her coral necklace and hang it on a twig. A raven came by, grabbed

the necklace, and flew off with it. The girl ran into the woods after the

raven and found her brothers‘ house. No one was at home, so she cooked

the noodles, spooned them onto the brothers‘ plates, and hid under a bed.

The brothers returned and, finding the noodles ready and waiting, sat

down and ate. But then they grew uneasy, suspecting the witches had

played a joke on them, for the woods were full of witches.

One of the twelve kept watch the next day and saw the girl jump out from

under the bed. When the brothers learned, she was not a witch but their

own little sister, they made a great to-do over her and insisted that she

remain with them. But they cautioned her to speak to no one in the woods,

because the place was full of witches.

One evening when the girl went to prepare supper, she found that the fire

had gone out. To save time, she went to a nearby cottage to get a light. An

old woman at the cottage graciously gave her the light, but said that, in

exchange, she would come to the girl on the morrow and suck a bit of

blood from her little finger.

―I can‘t let anyone in the house,‖ said the girl. ―My brothers forbid it.‖

―You don‘t even have to open the door,‖ replied the old woman. ―When I

knock, all you must do is stick your little finger through the keyhole, and

I‘ll suck it.‖

So, the old woman came by every evening to suck the blood from her,

while the girl grew paler and paler. Her brothers noticed it and asked her

so many questions that she admitted going to an old witch for a light and

102



having to pay for it with her blood. ―Just let us take care of her,‖ said the

brothers.

The witch arrived, knocked, and when the girl failed to stick her finger

through the keyhole, she poked her head through the cat door. One of the

brothers had his hatchet all ready and chopped off her head. Then they

pitched the remains into a ravine.

One day on the way to the fountain, the girl met another old woman, who

was selling white bowls.

―I have no money,‖ said the girl.

―In that case, I‘ll make you a present of them,‖ said the old woman.

So, when the brothers came home thirsty, they found twelve bowels filled

with water. They pitched in and drank, and instantly changed into a herd

of oxen. Only the twelfth, whose thirst was slight, barely touched the water

and turned into a lamb. The sister therefore found herself alone with eleven

oxen and one lamb to feed every day.

A prince out hunting went astray in the woods and, turning up at the girl‘s

house, fell in love with her. He asked her to marry him, but she replied that

she had to think of her oxen brothers and couldn‘t possibly leave them. The

prince took her to his palace along with all the brothers. The girl became

his princess bride, and the eleven oxen and the lamb were put into a

marble barn with gold mangers.

But the witches in the woods did not give up. One day the princess was

strolling under the grape arbor with her lambkin brother that she always

carried with her, when an old woman walked up to her.

―Will you give me a bunch of grapes, my good princess?‖

―Yes, dear old soul, help yourself.‖

―I can‘t reach up that high, please pick them for me.‖

―Right away,‖ said the princess, reaching up for a bunch.

103



―Pick that bunch there, they‘re the ripest,‖ said the old woman, pointing to

a bunch above the cistern.

To reach it, the princess had to stand on the rim of the cistern. The old

woman gave her a push, and the princess fell in. The lamb started bleating,

and bleated all around the cistern, but nobody understood what it was

bleating about, nor did they hear the princess moaning down in the well.

Meanwhile the witch had taken the princess‘s shape and got into her bed.

When the prince came home, he asked, ―What are you doing in bed?‖

―I‘m sick,‖ said the false princess. ―I need to eat a morsel of lamb. Slaughter

me that one out there that won‘t stop bleating.‖

―Didn‘t you tell me some time ago,‖ asked the prince, ―that the lamb was

your brother? And you want to eat him now?‖

The witch had blundered and was at a loss for words. The prince, sensing

that something was amiss, went into the garden and followed the lamb that

was bleating so pitifully. It approached the cistern, and the prince heard his

wife calling.

―What are you doing at the bottom of the cistern?‖ he exclaimed. ―Didn‘t I

just leave you in bed?‖

―No, I‘ve been down here ever since this morning! A witch threw me in!‖

The prince ordered his wife pulled up at once. The witch was caught and

burned at the stake. While the fire burned, the oxen and the lamb slowly

turned back into fine, strapping young men, and you‘d have thought the

castle had been invaded by a band of giants. They were all made princes,

while I‘ve stayed as poor a soul as ever.





Chapter 18 The Six Swans Story


Once on a time a king was hunting in a great wood, and he pursued a wild

animal so eagerly that none of his people could follow him. When evening

came, he stood still, and looking round him he found that he had lost his

104



way; and seeking a path, he found none. Then all at once he saw an old

woman with a nodding head coming up to him; and it was a witch.

―My good woman,‖ said he, ―can you show me the way out of the wood?‖

―Oh yes, my lord king,‖ answered she, ―certainly I can; but I must make a

condition, and if you do not fulfil it, you will never get out of the wood

again, but die there of hunger.‖

―What is the condition?‖ asked the king.

―I have a daughter,‖ said the old woman, ―who is as fair as any in the

world, and if you will take her for your bride, and make her queen, I will

show you the way out of the wood.‖

The king consented, because of the difficulty he was in, and the old woman

led him into her little house, and there her daughter was sitting by the fire.

She received the king just as if she had been expecting him, and though he

saw that she was very beautiful, she did not please him, and he could not

look at her without an inward shudder. Nevertheless, he took the maiden

before him on his horse, and the old woman showed him the way, and

soon he was in his royal castle again, where the wedding was held.

The king had been married before, and his first wife had left seven

children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved better than all the world,

and as he was afraid the step-mother might not behave well to them, and

perhaps would do them some mischief, he took them to a lonely castle

standing in the middle of a wood. There they remained hidden, for the

road to it was so hard to find that the king himself could not have found it,

had it not been for a clue of yarn, possessing wonderful properties, that a

wise woman had given him; when he threw it down before him, it unrolled

itself and showed him the way.

And the king went so often to see his dear children, that the queen was

displeased at his absence; and she became curious and wanted to know

what he went out into the wood for so often alone. She bribed his servants

with much money, and they showed her the secret, and told her of the clew

of yam, which alone could point out the way; then she gave herself no rest

105



until she had found out where the king kept the clew, and then she made

some little white silk shirts, and sewed a charm in each, as she had learned

witchcraft of her mother. And once when the king had ridden, to the hunt,

she took the little shirts and went into the wood, and the clew of yarn

showed her the way. The children seeing someone in the distance, thought

it was their dear father coming to see them, and came jumping for joy to

meet him. Then the wicked queen threw over each one of the little shirts,

and as soon as the shirts touched their bodies, they were changed into

swans, and flew away through the wood. So, the queen went home very

pleased to think she had got rid of her stepchildren; but the maiden had

not run out with her brothers, and so the queen knew nothing about her.

The next day the king went to see his children, but he found nobody but

his daughter.

―Where are thy brothers?‖ asked the king.

―Ah, dear father,‖ answered she, ―they are gone away and have left me

behind,‖ and then she told him how she had seen from her window her

brothers in the guise of swans fly away through the wood, and she showed

him the feathers which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she

had picked up. The king was grieved, but he never dreamt that it was the

queen who had done this wicked deed, and as he feared lest the maiden

also should be stolen away from him, he wished to take her away with

him. But she was afraid of the step-mother, and begged the king to let her

remain one more night in the castle in the wood.

Then she said to herself, ―I must stay here no longer, but go and seek for

my brothers.‖ And when the night came, she fled away and went straight

into the wood. She went on all that night and the next day, until she could

go no longer for weariness. At last she saw a rude hut, and she went in and

found a room with six little beds in it; she did not dare to lie down in one,

but she crept under one and lay on the hard boards and wished for night.

When it was near the time of sun-setting, she heard a rustling sound, and

saw six swans come flying in at the window. They alighted on the ground,

and blew at one another until they had blown all their feathers off, and

then they stripped off their swan-skin as if it had been a shirt. And the

106



maiden looked at them and knew them for her brothers, and was very

glad, and crept from under the bed. The brothers were not less glad when

their sister appeared, but their joy did not last long.

―You must not stay here,‖ said they to her; ―this is a robber‘ haunt, and if

they were to come and find you here, they would kill you.‖

―And cannot you defend me?‖ asked the little sister.

―No,‖ answered they, ―for we can only get rid of our swan-skins and keep

our human shape every evening for a quarter of an hour, but after that we

must be changed again into swans.‖ Their sister wept at hearing this, and

said, ―Can nothing be done to set you free?‖

―Oh no,‖ answered they, ―the work would be too hard for you. For six

whole years, you would be obliged never to speak or laugh, and make

during that time six little shirts out of aster-flowers. If you were to let fall a

single word before the work was ended, all would be of no good.‖ And just

as the brothers had finished telling her this, the quarter of an hour came to

an end, and they changed into swans and flew out of the window.

But the maiden made up her mind to set her brothers free, even though it

should cost her life. She left the hut, and going into the middle of the wood,

she climbed a tree, and there passed the night. The next morning, she set to

work and gathered asters and began sewing them together: as for speaking,

there was no one to speak to, and as for laughing, she had no mind to it; so,

she sat on and looked at nothing but her work. When she had been going

on like this for a long time, it happened that the king of that country went

a-hunting in the wood, and some of his huntsmen came up to the tree in

which the maiden sat. They called out to her, saying, ―Who art thou?‖ But

she gave no answer. ―Come down,‖ cried they; ―we will do thee no harm.‖

But she only shook her head. And when they tormented her further with

questions she threw down to them her gold necklace, hoping they would

be content with that. But they would not leave off, so she threw down to

them her girdle, and when that was no good, her garters, and one after

another everything she had on and could possibly spare, until she had

nothing left but her smock. But all was no good, the huntsmen would not

107



be put off any longer, and they climbed the tree, carried the maiden off,

and brought her to the king.

The king asked, ―Who art thou? What wert thou doing in the tree?‖ But she

answered nothing. He spoke to her in all the languages he knew, but she

remained dumb: but, being very beautiful, the king inclined to her, and he

felt a great love rise in his heart towards her; and casting his mantle round

her, he put her before him on his horse and brought her to his castle. Then

he caused rich clothing to be put upon her, and her beauty shone as bright

as the morning, but no word would she utter. He seated her by his side at

table, and her modesty and gentle mien so pleased him, that he said, ―This

maiden I choose for wife, and no other in all the world,‖ and accordingly

after a few days they were married.

But the king had a wicked mother, who was displeased with the marriage,

and spoke ill of the young queen. ―Who knows where the maid can have

come from?‖ said she, ―and not able to speak a word! She is not worthy of

a king!‖ After a year, had passed, and the queen brought her first child into

the world, the old woman carried it away, and marked the queen‘s mouth

with blood as she lay sleeping. Then she went to the king and declared that

his wife was an eater of human flesh. The king would not believe such a

thing, and ordered that no one should do her any harm. And the queen

went on quietly sewing the shirts and caring for nothing else. The next time

that a fine boy was born, the wicked step-mother used the same deceit, but

the king would give no credence to her words, for he said, ―She is too

tender and good to do any such thing, and if she were only not dumb, and

could justify herself, then her innocence would be as clear as day.‖ When

for the third time the old woman stole away the new-born child and

accused the queen, who was unable to say a word in her defense, the king

could do no other but give her up to justice, and she was sentenced to

suffer death by fire.

The day on which her sentence was to be carried out was the very last one

of the sixth year of the years during which she had neither spoken nor

laughed, to free her dear brothers from the evil spell. The six shirts were

ready, all except one which wanted the left sleeve. And when she was led

108



to the pile of wood, she carried the six shirts on her arm, and when she

mounted the pile and the fire was about to be kindled, all at once she cried

out aloud, for there were six swans coming flying; and she saw that her

deliverance was near, and her heart beat for joy.

The swans came close to her with rushing wings, and stooped round her,

so that she could throw the shirts over them; and when that had been done

the swanskins fell off them, and her brothers stood before her in their own

bodies quite safe and sound; but as one shirt wanted the left sleeve, so the

youngest brother had a swan‘s wing instead of a left arm. They embraced

and kissed each other, and the queen went up to the king, who looked on

full of astonishment, and began to speak to him and to say, ―Dearest

husband, now I may dare to speak and tell you that I am innocent, and

have been falsely accused,‖ and she related to him the treachery of the

step-mother, who had taken away the three children and hidden them.

And she was reconciled to the king with great joy, and the wicked step-

mother was bound to the stake on the pile of wood and burnt to ashes. And

the king and queen lived many years with their six brothers in peace and

joy.





Chapter 19 Tear not


One snowing day, a miller‘s wife was holding her baby daughter and softly

singing her to sleep. The miller‘s wife could not stop crying for she knew

she did not have long to live. Tears fell from her face and didn‘t seem to

stop, each droplet touched her baby‘s face, the baby struggled in her

mother‘s arms and cried along.

The mother stopped crying when she heard her daughter‘s wailing and

sighed: ―Oh how I wish that you will never be like me, oh how I wish you

may never shed a tear in your entire life!‖. At that moment, almost like

magic, the little baby girl stopped crying. The mother died the very next

day.

The girl grew up and though she wasn‘t exceptionally beautiful, she had a

sweet face and pretty eyes. Unfortunately, he fathers died when she turned

109



16 so she was left rather alone. At the funeral, she did not shed a single

tear, and when the villagers saw, they cried out

―Oh, what a wicked girl for not shedding a single tear for her poor father!‖

and thus they called her ―Tear not‖.

Tear not had to work very hard to maintain a life, however the villagers

thought she was so heartless that they often refused to sell her meat and

bread, and so Tear not lived a poor and hungry life. When at last she had

no home, she took shelter under a big oak tree which became her home.

It just happened that a prince from a nearby kingdom was passing the

village one day. When he saw the tattered girl, he stopped and ask: ―Why

are you sleeping under a big oak tree dear girl?‖

Before Tear not could reply a farmer answered: ―Why your highness, it is

mere good fortune for this impudent girl to be able to make shelter under

an oak tree!‖.

‖ And why do you say that?‖ the prince asked curiously. When the farmer

told the prince how cruel Tear not had been, the prince grew rather angry.

However, he saw that the girl had kind eyes and decided that no young

girl was fit to live under an oak tree and in such a tattered state. And so,

tear not was taken to the palace to be a sweeper.

Before Tear not left, she gently shook the bottom branch of the oak tree and

whispered:

―Oak tree, Oak tree,

Shake your leaves

Oak tree, Oak tree,

Wake and see

Oh, woe oh woe

I‘m a maid to be‖

At the palace, tear not was given the hardest chores and not long, everyone

in the palace learnt about her cruelty. One night when all the other maids

110



were in deep slumber, tear not was still sweeping the floor when she heard

a noise from the prince‘s room. Curiosity got the better of her and she went

to have a look. Any me, was she surprised! The candlelight had caught fire

on the table! Horror-stricken, tear not rushed to the prince and pulled him

out of his bed. When the prince awoke, he too, was horrified by the smoke

and rushed out of his room. When he looked back inside his room, he saw

admits the smoke, the shadow of a young girl. But before the prince could

see clearly who had saved his life, the smoke covered his vision as the

guards pulled her to away to safety.

Later, the youngest princess from another kingdom who was staying at the

palace for a visit went inside the prince‘s room to see if he was well. The

prince however, was not there. The princess started to leave when she

discovered a golden acorn half covered in candle wick under the prince‘s

bed, this, she picked up and placed securely in her pocket.

The next night, when Tear not was sweeping the floors, she heard the same

noise in the prince‘s room. This time the candlelight had caught fire on the

shelf! She ran quickly inside and awoke the prince just in time. Again, the

prince could only see the shadow of a coughing girl and nothing more. The

prince began to walk towards his smoked covered room to get a better

view of his savior when the Guards rushed out and dragged him away

from danger. Poor Tear not had no one to save her this time so she ran out

of the door and the melted wick of the candle caught onto the rim of her

dress and stained it quite well.

When the prince came back into his room, he was amazed to find a golden

acorn under his bed.

The prince could not stop thinking about the girl who risked her own life

twice to save his. Oh, how he wished he knew who she was! He swore to

marry only her. At last his worried mother could stand it no longer, she

held a ball in which the prince must dance with every girl in the palace

until he finds the girl who saved his life.

The prince danced and danced, and at last it was Tear not‘s turn. When the

price saw her, still wearing her tattered dress, he sighed and said: ―How

111



can you, a girl who would never shed a single tear, ever have the heart to

save me?‖

However, orders were orders, and he danced with her properly as a prince

should dance with any real princess.

When the dance was over, everyone was that the prince would never find

the girl. Suddenly, a beautiful princess wearing a lovely pink and silver

dress stepped down the stairs. She was the youngest princess from another

kingdom. She smiled sweetly at the prince who smiled back and offered his

hand. The two danced beautifully.

When the dance was over, the princess reached into her pocket and took

out the golden acorn and offered it to the prince. When the prince saw the

acorn, he was happy beyond belief, he had found her!

The prince took out his own golden acorn and gave it to the princess.

He took both her hands into his and cried: ―You are the one who risked

your life to save me, you are the one who I shall marry!‖

The young princess blushed and everyone clapped in joy.

Tear not watched in sadness, she wanted to cry, but she could not, she

could only feel her heart break into pieces. She had long fallen in love with

the handsome prince for she observed that he had a big heart and was very

kind to everyone. She looked sadly outside the window and thought she

could see the outline of the oak tree in the clouds.

She whispered:

―Oak tree, Oak tree

Shake your leaves

Oak tree, Oak tree

Wake and see

The girl who risked her life

was really me‖

112



As she finished her poem, the two golden acorns suddenly joined and

became stuck fast together. The prince and princess tried to pull them

apart, but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn‘t do so.

Then, the two acorns started to speak:

―Tear not and Tears, please tear us apart, only the true bride can tear us

apart‖

The pretty little princess took the acorns in both her hands and pulled with

all her might but they would not come apart. Every time she pulled to no

avail the acorns would chant:

―Only the true bride can tear us apart‖

The prince then asked the princess: ―are these not your acorns? are you not

my true savior?‖

―No!‖ the little princess cried: ―These are my acorns, I am your true savior,

these acorns speak harshly of me and I do not know why!‖

―Very well then‖ said the prince

―I will let every girl in this room try to tear these acorns apart, if no one

can, then I will order the golden acorns to be thrown to sea and I will take

you as my true bride‖

And so, every girl in the room tried and failed miserably, and finally, it was

almost Tear not‘s turn.

However, the prince by now grew wary and was sure that the little

princess was his true bride. He tossed the two acorns aside and they

landed near Tear not‘s feet.

The prince kissed the little princess on the forehead and said: ―Never mind

the acorns, they speak lies, you are my true bride‖

The prince‘s words pierced Tear not‘s heart so deep, she felt like knives

were stabbing at every angle of her body. She picked up the golden acorns

and gently held them in her hands. She recognized that they were the same

kind from the old oak she once lived under. She whispered

113



―Oak tree, Oak tree

Shake your leaves,

Oak Tree, Oak tree

Please help me,

Let me cry

Let me shed tears and tears‖

At that very moment, for the first time since she was a baby, tears of liquid

gold fell from her eyes. They touched the two acorns and to everyone

including the prince‘s amazement, the acorns came apart.

Tear not was so surprised that she ran away but the prince caught up and

grabbed her dress. His eye saw the candle wick stain on her tattered dress,

it was in the shape of an acorn.

―You are the one who saved me‖ He cried ―Would you be my true bride?‖

Tear not cried and cried, as if all the tears she held inside her were finally

pouring out. Tears of sadness, relief and joy. Her mother‘s spell was at last

broken.

The prince and Tear not married and lived happily ever after, the young

princess was sent back to her kingdom and did not marry until she was

much older. Every year on that day, the big oak tree bore golden acorns for

everyone to pick and keep as a reminder of a tearful story.



Chapter 20 The Frog Princess (The Prince who marries a

Frog) Story

There was once a Tsar who had three sons, and they were all dear to him,

but the youngest, Ivan, was the dearest of them all.

When the Princes grew to manhood the Tsar began to talk and talk to them

about getting married, but it so happened not one of the Princes had ever

seen the girl he wished to have for a wife. There were many in the kingdom

114



whom they might well have loved, but not one of them meant more to any

of the Princes than another.

―Very well, then,‖ said the Tsar at last, ―we will leave it to chance. Take

your bows and arrows and come with me into the courtyard. You shall

each shoot an arrow, and in whatever places your arrows fall, there shall

you take your brides.‖

The Princes were not greatly pleased with this plan, but still they dared not

say no to their father. They took their bows and went with him into the

courtyard.

First the eldest son shot his arrow, and he aimed it toward the east, where

the sun rises. The arrow fell upon the balcony of a great nobleman‘s house.

Well and good! The nobleman had a daughter, and she was so stately and

handsome that the Prince was very glad to take her for a wife.

Then the second Prince shot an arrow and aimed it toward the west, where

the sun is in its glory. He was no less lucky than his brother, for his arrow

fell into the court of a rich merchant, and he also had a daughter who was a

beauty. So the second son took her for a bride, and he was well content.

Last of all Prince Ivan shot his arrow, and he aimed neither toward the east

nor the west, but straight up into the sky above him. Then a sudden gust of

wind arose and caught the arrow and blew it away so that it fell in a great

swamp. In this swamp were no rich nor beautiful ladies, but only a poor,

green, croaking frog.

When the young Prince Ivan saw where his arrow had fallen he was in

despair. ―How can I marry a frog,‖ said he, ―and have her rule with me as

my Princess?‖

―It is a great pity,‖ said the Tsar; ―nevertheless what I have said I have said,

and where your arrow fell there must you take your bride.‖

So, Prince Ivan was married to the frog, and the Tsar built a castle on the

edge of the swamp for them to live in.

115



Now the Tsar was growing old, and he began to consider in his mind to

which of his sons he would leave his kingdom. Gladly would he have left it

to his youngest son, who was his favorite, but it did not seem right that a

frog should ever rule over the kingdom as Queen.

At last he called the three Princes before him and said, ―My sons, to-

morrow let your wives bake me some soft white bread. I will eat of it, and

in this way, I will know which of you has the cleverest wife, and he who

has the cleverest wife shall inherit my kingdom.‖

After they had heard him the three Princes went away to their own homes,

and Prince Ivan was very sad.

―What ails you, my dear husband,‖ said the frog, ―that you hang your head

and are so downcast?‖

―It is no wonder I am downcast,‖ answered Prince Ivan. ―My father has

commanded that you shall make him a loaf of soft white bread to-morrow,

and well I know that your webby fingers can never make bread that he

would taste or even so much as look at.‖

―Do not be too sure of that,‖ answered the frog. ―Sleep in peace, and I

promise that to-morrow I will provide a loaf that even the Tsar will be glad

to eat of.‖

The Prince did not believe this, but grief is heavy, so no sooner was he in

bed than he fell into a deep sleep.

Then the frog arose from beside him and went into a far-off room and took

off her frog-skin; for she was really a Princess who had been enchanted.

She combed her hair and washed herself and then she went out on the

balcony of the castle and cried, ―Nurses dear, nurses dear, bring me a loaf

of bread such as I used to have in the palace of my own dear father, the

King.‖

After she had called these three times three crows appeared, carrying

among them a fine napkin embroidered with gold, and in this napkin, was

a loaf of bread. They laid the napkin before the Princess and bowed three

times, croaking solemnly, and then they flew away again into the night.

116



The Princess took up the bread and went back into the room and put on

her frog-skin again; after that she returned to her chamber and lay down

beside her husband.

The next day when the Prince was ready to set out for the Tsar‘s palace, the

frog brought him the loaf of bread still wrapped in the napkin.

―Take this, dear husband,‖ said she, ―and carry it to your father, the Tsar,

but do not open it on the way lest the dust should spoil the fineness of the

bread.‖

The Prince took the loaf and rode away with it, but he could not forbear

from peeping into the napkin to see what was there, and what he saw filled

him with admiration and wonder. Quickly he rode on his way, and soon

reached the Tsar‘s palace.

The two older brothers were there, and each brought a loaf of fine white

bread that his wife had made.

When Prince Ivan entered, his brothers could not forbear from smiling.

―Come!‖ said they, ―show us quickly what kind of bread the Frog Princess

has made. Does it smell of reeds and rushes?‖

The young Prince made no answer but gave what he carried to his father.

When the Tsar saw the fineness of the napkin and the beautiful embroidery

upon it he was very much surprised. But he was still more surprised when

he opened the napkin and saw what it contained. Never had he seen such

bread. Not only was it soft and light and fine, but it was molded along the

sides in cunning scenes, castles and cities, moats and bridges, and upon the

top was the imprint of the royal eagle, perfect even to the claws and

feathers.

The Tsar could not admire it enough. Still he was not willing to leave the

kingdom to Prince Ivan and so make a queen of a frog.

―This is very beautiful, but a loaf of bread is soon eaten and forgotten,‖

said he. ―I now wish each one of you to bring me a carpet to lay before my

throne, and he who brings me the finest carpet, him will I make my heir.‖

117



The Princes returned to their own homes, and the youngest one was very

sad and sorrowful.

―What ails you, my dear husband?‖ asked the frog. ―Why are you so

downcast, and why do you hang your head. Was not the Tsar pleased with

the bread you carried to him?‖

―He was well pleased,‖ answered the Prince; ―but now he has commanded

each one of us to bring him a carpet, and to him who brings the finest

carpet he will leave his kingdom. No wonder I am sad, for where, in this

swamp, can I find a carpet such as I require?‖

―Do not trouble yourself about that,‖ answered the frog. ―Do you go and

lie down and go quietly to sleep. I will supply you such a carpet as you

need.‖

The Prince did not believe her, but because grief is heavy he lay down and

soon fell into a deep sleep.

Again, as before the frog stole away to a distant chamber and laid aside her

frog-skin. Then she went out on the balcony and cried aloud three times;

―Nurses dear, nurses true, bring me a carpet such as lay before my bed in

my own home.‖

At once the three crows appeared, carrying among them a carpet rolled up

and covered with a piece of embroidered velvet. They laid the roll before

the Princess, bowed three times, and then flew away again.

The Princess carried the carpet back into the chamber and put on her frog-

skin again, and then she went back and lay down quietly beside the Prince.

The next morning when the Prince was ready to set out, the frog brought

the roll of carpet to him.

―Here,‖ said she; ―carry this to your father, but do not open it upon the

way lest the dust spoil its beauty.‖

The Prince took the carpet and rode away. When he reached the Tsar‘s

palace his two brothers were already there, and each had brought with him

118



a piece of carpet so fine and rich that it was difficult to say which of the two

was the more beautiful.

When the older brothers saw Ivan, they began to laugh. ―Come!‖ said they.

―Let us see what kind of a carpet he has brought from his swamp home. No

doubt it is very wonderful.‖

The Prince laid the roll of carpet upon the floor and opened it out and

when they saw it every one was struck with wonder. The elder Princes had

not a word to say. Never had they seen such a carpet. Not only was it as

thick and soft as eiderdown, but it shone with wondrous colors that

changed as one looked at them, and it was embroidered with gold in

strange designs.

The Tsar was filled with admiration. All the same he still was unwilling to

have a frog reign in his kingdom.

―This is all very well,‖ said he, ―and never have I seen such a beautiful

carpet. But now I wish you all to appear before me to-morrow with your

wives. Let the Princesses wear their most beautiful dresses and their finest

jewels, and whichever of you has the wife best fitted to be Queen, to him

will I leave the kingdom.‖

When the Prince Ivan heard this, he was in despair. How could he ever

bring the frog to court and present her to the Tsar as though she were a

beautiful Princess?

When he went home the frog at once asked him why he was so sad and

woebegone. ―Is not the kingdom to be yours?‖ she asked.

―No,‖ answered the Prince, ―for now my father, the Tsar, has demanded

something else of us.‖ He then told her how the Tsar had bidden him and

his brothers bring their wives to court, and had said that whichever of the

Princesses was the finest and most beautiful should reign as Queen, and

her husband should be the Tsar.

―Do not trouble over that,‖ said the frog. ―Only go to bed and sleep quietly.

The kingdom shall still be yours.‖

119



Then the Prince went to bed, but he only closed his eyes and pretended to

go to sleep, for he had grown very curious as to how the frog had been able

to provide him with the wonderful loaf and the carpet.

The frog kept very still until she thought the Prince was asleep. Then she

arose quietly from his side and slipped away, but the Prince also arose and

followed her without her being aware of it. She went to the far-off

chamber, and there she laid aside her frog-skin; and when the prince saw

her in her human form he was amazed at her beauty, and his heart melted

within him for love of her, for her hair was like spun gold, her eyes as blue

as the sky, and her skin as white as milk. Never had he seen such a beauty.

The Princess went out on a balcony as she had before, and cried aloud

three times, ―Nurses dear, nurses true, bring me fine clothes and jewels to

wear, richer than ever were seen before.‖

At once the three crows appeared, carrying with them jewels and fine robes

all encrusted with gems and embroidery. These they laid at the Princess‘s

feet and bowed three times, croaking hoarsely, and then they flew away.

The Princess took the robes and jewels back into the chamber to hide them,

and while she was doing this Prince Ivan returned to his bed and lay down

and closed his eyes as though he were asleep. When the frog came back she

looked at him carefully, but he kept so still she never guessed that he had

stirred from where he lay.

The next morning the frog bade Ivan ride away alone to the palace of the

Tsar. ―I will follow you,‖ she said, ―and when you hear a great noise, say,

‗That is my little Foggier, driving up in her basket made of rushes.‘‖

The Prince promised to do this and then he rode away to the palace of the

Tsar.

His brothers were already there, and their two wives were with them, both

so handsome and so magnificently dressed that each looked finer than the

other.

120



When Ivan came in they all began to laugh. ―Where is thy dear frog?‖ they

asked. ―Is she still asleep among her reeds and rushes, or is she too hoarse

to come?‖

Even as they spoke there was a great noise outside, –a roaring and

rumbling like thunder.

The palace shook until it appears it would fall about their ears. Everyone

was terrified. Only Prince Ivan was calm.

―There is my little Foggier now,‖ he said; ―she is driving up in her little

basket of rushes.‖

At once the noise ceased, the doors were flung open, and a magnificent

Princess swept into the room. Never was such a beauty seen before. Her

golden hair fell almost to the floor and was bound about with jewels. Her

robes were stiff with embroidery and gems. The other Princesses paled

before her as stars pale before the rising moon.

Prince Ivan took her by the hand and led her to the Tsar. ―This is my dear

Princess,‖ said he, ―and surely it is she and she only who should reign over

this land.‖

Well, there were no two ways to that. The Tsar could hardly contain

himself for joy over the beauty of Prince Ivan‘s bride. A great feast was

spread, and the Tsar himself led the Princess to the table. She sat at his

right hand and drank from his jeweled cup, and all was joy and merriment.

Only the older brothers and their wives were sad, for they knew they had

missed all chance of gaining the kingdom.

Now while they were still at the table, all eating and drinking, Prince Ivan

arose and made some excuse for leaving the room. He went quietly and

mounted his horse and rode back to his own castle.

There he made haste to the room where his wife had left her frog-skin. He

hunted about until he found it, and then he threw it into the fire, for he did

not intend that she should ever hide herself away in it again.

121



At once a clap of thunder sounded, and the Princess stood before him. Her

eyes were streaming with tears, and she wrung her hands in grief.

―Alas and woe is me!‖ she cried. ―Why did you burn my frog-skin? A little

longer, and I would have been free. Now I must go away and leave you

forever.‖

―But where are you going?‖ cried the Prince in despair. ―Wherever it is I

will follow and find you.‖

―Seek me beyond the seven mountains, beyond the seven seas, in the

kingdom of Kachcheri the Deathless, for it is in his house I will be,‖

answered the Princess. Then she turned into a great white swan and flew

out through the window and far, far away; so far, the Prince could no

longer see her.

Then Prince Ivan was filled with grief; and he neither stayed nor tarried

but set out at once in search of his Princess.

He journeyed on and journeyed on a short way and a long way, and then

he met an old man with a grey beard that hung down far below his belt.

―Good day, good youth,‖ said the old man.

―Good day, grandfather,‖ answered Ivan.

―Whither do you journey with so sad a face?‖ asked the stranger.

―I journey over land and over sea in search of the kingdom of Kachcheri

the Deathless,‖ answered Ivan.

―Then you have a long journey before you,‖ said the old man. ―But why do

you seek the kingdom of Kachcheri the Deathless, that terrible man?‖

―I seek it that I may find what is lost.‖ Then Ivan told the old man his story,

all about his frog bride and how she had turned into a Princess, –how he

had burned the frog-skin and how she had flown away as a swan, and that

now life would be nothing but a burden to him until he could find her

again.

122



The old man shook his head. ―Alas! alas! You should never have burned

the frog-skin!‖ he said. He then told Ivan that the name of the Princess was

Vasilis the Fair. ―Her mother was the sister of Kachcheri the Deathless,‖

said the stranger, ―and when she was born it was foretold that before she

was eighteen Kachcheri should lose his life because of her. It was for this

reason that he changed her into a frog and set her during the lonely

swamp. In a month and a day from now the Princess would have been

eighteen, and the danger to Kachcheri would have been over. Then he

would have allowed her to lay aside her frog-skin and take back her

human shape. But now he is angry and has carried her away to his castle,

and only by the grace of Heaven will you be able to find her and set her

free.‖

The old man then gave Prince Ivan a little ball. ―Take this,‖ he said, ―and

roll it before you as you go. It will show you which way to travel, and with

its help you may reach the kingdom of Kachcheri.‖

Ivan took the ball and thanked the old man and journeyed on. He rolled

the ball before him, and in whichever direction it rolled he followed.

He went along and went along, until after a while he came to a forest, and

there he saw a bear.

Prince Ivan would have shot it, but the bear cried to him, ―Do not shoot

me, Prince. Take me with you as a servant, and the time may come when I

can help you.‖

―Very well,‖ said the Prince. ―Come with me‖; so, he journeyed on with the

bear at his heels.

Presently he saw a wild duck and would have shot it, but the duck called

to him, ―Do not shoot me, dear Prince. Take me with you, and I will be a

faithful servant. The time may come when you will need me.‖

―Very well,‖ answered the Prince. ―You also may come with us as a

companion.‖

So, the Prince journeyed along with the bear at his heels and the duck

flying overhead.

123



After a while they came to the edge of a river, and there lay a great fish,

gasping out its life in the sunlight.

―Now at last I shall have a good meal,‖ said the Prince.

But the fish cried to him in a human voice, ―Throw me back into the river,

Prince, that I may live. The time may come when I can do you a good turn

also.‖

So, the Prince had mercy on the fish and threw it back into the water.

After that he and his companions traveled on a long way. They journeyed

over seven mountains and crossed seven seas, and so they came at last to

the kingdom of Kachcheri the Deathless.

There the Prince saw a little hut. It stood on hen‘s legs and turned this way

and that, whichever way the wind blew. There was no getting at the door.

Then the Prince cried, ―Little hut, stand the way my mother built you with

your back away from me and your door before me.‖

At once the hut whirled round and stood with the open door in front of

him.

Prince Ivan entered in, and saw a bony-legged Baba Yage lying on the

stove with her grey hair over her face.

―Who are you? And what seek you here in the kingdom of Kachcheri the

Deathless?‖ she cried.

―Do not ask questions but rise up and give me food and drink,‖ said the

Prince; ―for I am both hungry and thirsty.‖

The Baba Yage arose and served him food and drink. He ate and gave part

to the bear and the duck. Then he told the Baba Yage why he had come

there–that he was wandering in search of his dear wife, Vasilis the Fair.

The old witch shook her head. ―It will be a hard thing to rescue her,‖ she

said. ―Kachcheri is very powerful. Only in one way can you overcome him.

Not far from here stands a tree. It is as hard as rock, so that no ax can dent

it, and so smooth that none can climb it. On the top of it is a nest. In the

124



nest is an egg. A duck sits over the egg to guard it. In that egg is a needle,

and only with that needle can you kill Kachcheri the Deathless.‖

The Baba Yage then led Prince Ivan to the door and pointed out to him

where the tree grew, and Prince Ivan hurried on toward it, with his two

faithful servants, the bear and the duck.

But when he reached the tree he looked at it with despair. It was indeed

very smooth and high, –as smooth as glass, and when he tried his hunting

knife upon it the knife bent and crumpled in his hand.

―Master, now is the time that I can help you,‖ said the bear. He went to the

tree and clasped it and shook it, so that its roots cracked, and it fell with a

mighty noise.

At once the duck that was guarding the egg caught it up in its claws and

flew away with it. But Ivan‘s duck pursued so fiercely that the other was

forced to drop the egg to defend itself.

Unfortunately, they had both flown over a river, and into this river the egg

dropped and was lost to sight.

Ivan sat down upon the bank of the river and wept. ―Alas, alas!‖ he cried.

―Now truly is my dear wife lost to me, for never can I recover the egg from

the river.‖

Hardly had he spoken when the fish he had thrown back into the river

appeared, bearing the egg in its mouth.

Now Ivan‘s grief was turned to rejoicing. He broke the egg and took out

the needle. Then, with the little ball to lead him, he soon made his way to

Kachcheri‘s palace.

The Deathless One rushed out to meet him, but Ivan attacked him with the

point of the needle. It was in vain Kachcheri tried to protect himself. Ivan

drove the needle into him deeper and deeper, and presently Kachcheri

sank down dead before him, no better than a lump of clay.

125



Prince Ivan strode across him and on into the castle. From room to room he

went, and in the deepest dungeon he found the Princess Vasilis, his own

dear wife. She threw herself into his arms, weeping with joy.

Then they went to Kachcheri‘s treasure room and took from it all the most

precious jewels, –all that the faithful bear could carry they loaded upon his

back and carried away with them.

After that they journeyed back to their own kingdom, and if anyone was

glad to see them it was the Tsar himself.

He built for them a castle close to his own, where they could not even see

the swamp. There Ivan and his frog princess lived in the greatest love and

happiness, and after the old Tsar‘s death they themselves ruled over the

kingdom as the Tsar and Tsarist.
